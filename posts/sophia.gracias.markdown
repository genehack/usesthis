### Who are you, and what do you do?

[Sophia Gracias](http://www.sophiagracias.com/ "Sophia's website."), Creative Lady & Melbournite. Currently working full time in stationery product design. On the side I work as a surface designer and artist.

### What hardware do you use?

I use an ASUS PC from many years ago that's plugged into a gaming monitor. I'm struggling to let go of it because I love it and I really dislike changing technology. Eventually I'll get a Mac and it'll be a game changer - many people have assured me of this. 

When I'm making art I use various mediums, including pen, found papers & glue, or Gouache. I recently learned that a lot of people don't know what Gouache is, and I would describe it as useful watercolour-style paint. I've tried to use expensive paint brushes, but the one I got for free in a watercolour set works the best for me every time.

### And what software?

I'm using [Adobe Creative Suite][creative-suite], [Microsoft Office][office] & [Dropbox][] religiously. [Google Docs][google-docs], [WeTransfer][] and [Instagram][] for in between. One day I'd like to expand my software skill set and learn some CAD for 3D product and mold development.

Recently I've been using [Slack][], strictly outside of working hours of course. It's the only way I can get my daily quota for using the `:pray:` emoji up. Also, it makes me feel connected to some pretty incredible people.

### What would be your dream setup?

This reads like a wishlist for Santa Claus:

- A brand new Macbook Pro
- iPad Pro & Apple Pen
- Noise-cancelling headphones
- A Herman Miller Aeron
- A fancy Swedish style desk
- One of those taps that has fizzy mineral water freely flowing from it
- A pack of black Gel Pens that don't give my ring finger a sad little bump
- One of those Gouache Sets with Japanese writing on it (everyone on Instagram uses them and I suspect that they could be magic)
- A corner office in the Flatiron Building in NYC
