### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Mars Buttfield-Addison](https://themartianlife.com/ "Mars' website.") but you may know me as [@TheMartianLife](https://twitter.com/TheMartianLife "Mars' Twitter account."). I'm currently a PhD Candidate at the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/ "The University of Tasmania."), working with [CSIRO's Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/ "A data science group at the CSIRO.") to investigate the ways machine learning methods can improve our ability to **reliably** and **accurately** identify and track objects in orbit using existing radio astronomy resourcesâ€”particularly small fragment space debris. This is my latest in a number of roles that involve designing AI-powered solutions for complex domains across industry and academia. In addition to this day job, I am also:

* a frequent volunteer and tech speaker at industry events all over the world; 
* a teaching and research assistant at my university; 
* a freelance software developer and author of educational materialsâ€”including _Practical AI with Swift_ for O'Reilly Media (as Mars Geldard), and related books still in the works; 
* a conference organiser of [/dev/world](https://devworld.com.au/ "A macOS, iOS and Swift conference.") and [EveryWorld](https://everyworld.com.au/ "A conference about Apple technology."), 
* an industry council member ([AUC National](https://auc.edu.au/about/auc-executive/ "Details about the AUC executives."), prev. [ACS Tasmania](https://www.acs.org.au/branches/tasmania.html "The Tasmanian branch of the ACS.")) and community advocate in the field of [Swift][] and Apple platform development; and
* a member of the [WesterosCraft](https://westeroscraft.com/ "A project to recreate the Game of Thrones world im Minecraft.") project team that is slowly recreating the entire world of Game of Thrones in [Minecraft][]...

...among many other side hustles. 

### What hardware do you use?

I share a 32mÂ² (345ftÂ²) micro-apartment with [my husband](https://hey.paris/ "Paris' website.") who is also in tech and we even share [a desk][vibe-desk], so at home we each just have a home-built mini tower computer with a single monitor. Mine is a [Cougar QBX case][qbx] with a teeny tiny [ASRock X570 motherboard][x570], a [Ryzen 5 2600][ryzen-5-2600], an [NVIDIA 1060][geforce-gtx-1060], and 32GB RAM. My peripherals are a [small Keychron K1 keyboard][k1], a [RIG 800 headset][rig-800hd], and **the best mouse in the world**: the [Gigabyte AIVIA M8600][aivia-m8600]. My monitor is just the cheapest 28" Kogan monitor I could find when my last decade-old monitor died and it's *the worst*. And our whole house runs off a single [AirPort Extreme][airport-extreme].

But I move around a lot between my university office and home and travelling for conferences, so I also have to be highly portable. Most of my work is done on a [16-inch 2019 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (i9, with 32GB memory and dedicated graphics) that I love to pieces; I can train complex machine learning models on-device in a matter of hours, and I do graphics stuff and have like 400 million tabs and papers open all the time and it doesn't miss a beat. It also works great with the new USB-C YubiKeys.

I also own a second-hand [iPhone 8][iphone-8], a [series 3 Apple Watch][apple-watch-series-3], and an old [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] with first-gen [Apple Pencil][pencil] that I use for proper work things like teaching and prototyping but that I mostly got so I could watch Star Trek at the gym. And I have an eGPU made up of a hand-me-down [Radeon R9 290][radeon-r9-290] GPU in a [Razer Core X][core-x] case that I bought on sale and intended to use to accelerate some of my machine learning or rendering work but it's slightly annoying to setup in [macOS][] and cloud resources are so easy nowadays that I really just use it to play video games on my MacBook.

### And what software?

My most important tasks of a day are research writing and coding. Though [Microsoft Word][word] is sometimes an inescapable fact of life, wherever possible I like to typeset beautiful documents in [LaTeX][] with [Texpad][]. For code, where I used to use [Xcode][] for Swift and [BBEdit][] for everything else, I have increasingly migrated to [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code]. Likewise, it's great for fast composition of documents from simple [Markdown][] or plain text with its Markdown PDF extension. Along with my overnight adoption of [Deckset][] for presentations (thanks [Vicky](https://usesthis.com/interviews/vm.brasseur/ "Vicky's Uses This interview.")!), this increased use of Markdown for my non-research written work has encouraged me more and more to keep it in version control on [GitHub][] as I do with code. So even for my PhD project, my supervisors and I collaborate on a private repository of Markdown documents that keep a history of our meeting notes and ideas and proposals as they evolve.

For the research side I manage resources with [ReadCube Papers][papers] (or just [BibDesk][] if I'm lazy) and I have every flavour of web browserâ€”though [Safari][] is my favourite. And when one of my side-hustles inevitably calls for imagery I do graphics work in the all-powerful [Sketch][], drawing on my iPad in [Procreate][procreate-ios] and final edits in [Pixelmator Pro][pixelmator-pro]. I also use a bit of the [Unity][] game engine to teach AI concepts and make 3D bots. It's great but I would also like to learn [Godot Engine][godot-engine] as an open source alternative that's a bit more accessible.

I manage passwords with [1Password][], block ads with [1Blocker][], diff files with [Kaleidoscope][], manage memory with [DaisyDisk][], and keep everything backed up with [Backblaze][] and [Time Machine][time-machine]. Comms happen through [Fastmail email][fastmail], [Twitter][twitter-ios], [Discord][], [Zoom][zoom.2], or [Slack][] (if I absolutely have to).

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm not super unhappy with what I have now. I like to reduce waste by using hand-me-downs and I've pretty much gotten used to working with whatever I have. If I could change anything about my setup anywhere it would be more about wishing I had a magical way to block background noise in my office when I'm on a call or something. Maybe some extra room to put a second monitor or some cool dock or switches so I could use the same peripherals with both of my computers without unplugging everything or re-arranging my desk. Some futuristic modular suitcase so I could take my whole setup to LANs, maybe. Or more indoor plants?

In my wildest dreams I'd take a [3090][geforce-rtx-3090] graphics card and some huge complicated gamer computer setup that people call a "battlestation" and that looks like the cockpit of a spaceship and has monitors everywhere, but I don't need it. As long as I've got things that work, I'm good ðŸ™‚
