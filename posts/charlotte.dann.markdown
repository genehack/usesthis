### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I'm [Charlotte Dann](https://charlottedann.com/ "Charlotte's website."). I'm a London-based "creative technologist and maker" or "web developer" or "jewellery designer", depending on who's asking. I spend half my time working as a front-end engineer for a death industry startup called [Farewill](https://farewill.com/ "A service to help deal with death."), and the rest of the time playing with code and fun machines in my converted shipping container studio.

In 2017 I found my ultimate jewellery/coding hybrid project in [Hexatope][], a web app where you can design your own jewellery which I then fabricate. Currently I'm experimenting with generative art jigsaw puzzles at [@abstractpuzzles](https://www.instagram.com/abstractpuzzles/ "Charlotte's generated puzzles account on Instagram.") on [Instagram][], and am working on a new business which crafts memorial jewellery out of ashes and glass (odd, but cool).

I also like to read a lot and I make book reviews and discussion videos [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/chareads "Charlotte's book review account on YouTube.") under the name [Chareads](https://chareads.com/ "Charlotte's book review site.").

### What hardware do you use?

In an endlessly uphill battle, I am Windows gal through and through. My only computer is my darling maxed-out [Microsoft Surface Book][surface-book] which is always paired with a [Logitech MX Master 3 mouse][mx-master-3], and in my studio it's hooked up to a [Dell UltraSharp monitor][u2415].

For videos and photos I have a [Nikon 5100][d5100] often accompanied by a [Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 lens][18-35mm-1.8-dc-hsm] and a [Zoom H2n microphone][h2n], with softbox lights and a C-stand for overhead mounts.

Now in descending coolness, all of my other work friends:

- A [Formlabs Form 2 3D printer][form-2], mostly for printing wax jewellery pieces
- An [Axidraw V3/A3 pen plotter][axidraw-v3-a3], mostly for fun, who am I kidding
- 3 kilns; a tiny furnace for melting metal, a [Skutt Firebox 8][firebox-8x6-lt] for fused glasswork, and a chunky Paragon W13 for lost wax casting
- A [Gryphon wet belt sander][wet-belt-sander] for glass, maybe my messiest and most crude machine, but I have a such a soft spot for it
- A vacuum investing and lost-wax casting machine with a huge bell jar which makes me look like an eccentric chemist
- A [Sievert Pro 86 torch][pro-86] and a tank of propane for soldering
- A [Dremel Fortiflex][fortiflex] for drilling/sanding/polishing
- A [Spa Plating tank electroplating kit][gold-tank-plating-kit]
- A Crock-Pot full of acid (we call it 'pickle' but it's more dramatic if I say acid) which is used for cleaning metal
- A barrelling machine for polishing metal
- An ultrasonic cleaner
- Endless pliers, hammers and files
- A rather neglected sewing machine

I'm also a very amateur carpenter, and have accumulated a bunch of power tools including a drill, jigsaw, circular saw, mitre saw, and orbital sander, all from Bosch. Most of my studio furniture is made from plywood sheets and propped up with [IKEA LERBERG][lerberg] trestles or [HYLLIS shelves][hyllis]. I use metal tote pans for storage so the aesthetic is half industrial workshop and half high-tech chic.

### And what software?

For web stuff I use [VSCode][visual-studio-code], with [ConEmu][] and [Git BASH][git-for-windows]. Despite insisting I'm a CSS Developer I have reluctantly become a [JavaScript][] developer, working mostly in [ReactJS][react] and sometimes with [Gatsby][]. I live in [Chrome][], with [Gmail][] for email, and [Slack][] for team comms, all tediously conventional.

I use [Todoist][] to plan my day and my life, [Loop Habits][loop-habits-android] to make sure I'm on track, [Notion][] to document everything, and [IFTTT][] to hook a bunch of things together.

Sometimes I use [Figma][] for designing websites but do a lot of other design in the [Adobe Suite][creative-suite], I get good mileage out of [Photoshop][], [Illustrator][], [InDesign][] and [Bridge][], and I use [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro] for video editing.

I use [Rhino][] and its scripting interface [Grasshopper][] for 3D design and prepping files for 3D printing.

### What would be your dream setup?

I think we can agree I have enough stuff already, but if you twisted my arm I'd love a laser cutter ([Epilog Fusion M2 40][fusion-m2-40]), a CNC router (a Shopbot?), an engraving machine ([Gravograph M20][m20]), an upgraded [Formlabs printer][form-3], and a [Festool workbench][mft-3] with their whole array of power tools.

I would also like to migrate my studio to a big, airy, sky-lit space overlooking green fields and ambling cows. Oh, and a [Surface Ergonomic Keyboard][surface-ergonomic-keyboard].
