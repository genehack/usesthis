### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Heather Flowers](https://twitter.com/HTHRFLWRS "Heather's Twitter account."). I'm an independent game developer and writer, currently working on the [_Extreme Meatpunks Forever_][extreme-meatpunks-forever] game series (Seasons 1 and 2 out now), about gay disasters beating up Neo-Nazis in giant robots made of meat.

### What hardware do you use?

I work using a refurbished [Lenovo ThinkPad P50][thinkpad-p50]. It's a solid laptop -- strong enough that I'll be using it for years to come, while still maintaining a kind of brutalist elegance.

### And what software?

I program my games in [Unity][] engine (specifically v2018.3). I code [C#][c-sharp] in [Sublime Text][sublime-text] with a personalized theme I put together a while back. I write in [Yarn][], a [Twine][]-like program used for game dialog. For static art assets, I tend to use stylized ASCII art, so a common workflow is to make a basic ASCII image in [Notepad][], port it into [Glimpse][] (a [GNU Image Manipulation Program][gimp] fork), color/edit it there, and export to Unity. For animations, I use [Aseprite][].

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup is honestly similar to my present setup, but more powerful. Part of the reason I enjoy the ThinkPad P50 is that it has lots of room to grow: it's an easily modded machine, so with the right setup it can become really powerful for a laptop. I don't think I'd want to switch to a desktop, long term -- ironically, mobility is an important aspect in my working from home routine. Being able to pick up my workstation and move it elsewhere in my home allows for a strong routine and greater work hygiene, which is important to my mental health.

Software-wise, I want to begin incorporating [Blender][] for 3D modeling into my workflow, but I have some more learning to do before I feel confident working with it professionally.
