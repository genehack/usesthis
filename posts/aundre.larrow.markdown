### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Aundre Larrow](https://www.aundrelarrow.com/ "Aundre's website."), I am a Brooklyn based visual artist that specializes in portrait photography but is stumbling his way into the video space.

My mother and I immigrated from Jamaica around my 3rd birthday and after a brief stint in NY we settled in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

A bit later my theater teacher, Lee Tempest, gave me my first piece of photo hardware, a Minolta [SR-T 101][sr-t-101]. Since that point at age 15, this life as a creative has been kind of a mess for me. More closed doors than open ones actually helped a lot because it helped me figure out where to go next.

### What hardware do you use?

Hardware is kind of dumb because it creates false barriers to entry for people and being a creative is already hella costly as is. But here goes.

[iPad Pro][ipad-pro] w/the [Pencil][], I use this all the time to edit on planes (sounds crazy, but I fly a lot and I frequently am behind the 8-ball on client projects, so being able to download images locally to [Lightroom][lightroom-ios] and edit with the pencil is clutch AF.)

[MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], standard guy. I actually find the laptop to be kind of prohibitive for photo editing but literally every other part of my job, from [QuickBooks][], to emails to production all goes through this mighty foldable computer.

Canon [Mark IV][eos-5d-mark-iv] w/ [50mm 1.4][ef-50mm-f1.4-usm], [85mm 1.8][ef-85mm-f1.8-usm], [35mm 1.4][ef-35mm-f1.4l-usm]. Cameras aren't as important as lenses, don't let anyone tell ya different. I have always loved the UI of the 5D series and the feeling of looking through an optical viewfinder, especially on a full frame camera.

I recently added a [Mac Mini][mac-mini] to the mix that acts as my backup manager for all my shoots and for getting it on [Backblaze][], etc. and let me tell you, it's something special.

Also for what it's worth I am a big iPhone and [Switch][switch.2] fan. although I love my [PS4][] I get a lot of anxiety about sitting down that long to play anything, so the Switch is a nice median, especially for long flights - I can tumble into a fictional world for 90 minutes and hop back to work a little less stressed.

The iPhone is legit awesome, it's filled with tabs I never read and photos of memories that are best unsettled by DSLRs.

### And what software?

[Adobe Suite][creative-suite], particularly [Lightroom][], [Photoshop][], [Premiere][], [Rush][premiere-rush] and [Audition][]. Lightroom is my new favorite baby as of 2016. Organization, and editing, plus with CC I can share gallery proofs with clients. Rush because premiere can get really intense and rush handles vertical video really well.

Mobile apps: [VSCO][vsco-ios] and [Unfold][unfold-ios]. Unfold specifically helps me layout client work on IG stories.

### What would be your dream setup?

Things I have the delight of borrowing but aren't normally in my setup:

- DJI [gimbal][ronin-s].
- Canon [C200 cinema camera][eos-c200] (s/o to Paul Hawxhurst): who knew it would feel so seamless to transition from DSLR to cinema camera?
- Canon [24-70mm 2.8][ef-24-70mm-f2.8l-usm] - hella versatile.
- Canon [50mm 1.2L][ef-50mm-f1.2l-usm] - god this is such a lovely lens.
