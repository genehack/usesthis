### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello w0rld! My name is Stelios. I am an information security geek. I am very interested in music, animal welfare, philosophy and health. I spend most of my time leading the [Greenbridge](https://greenbridge.gr/ "A non-profit designed to bring together the security, art and animal welfare communities.") project - a nonprofit initiative aiming to bring the cybersecurity, creative arts and animal welfare communities closer to each other. I am also the organiser of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ "A research community trying to find the best wasys to help people.") Greece, and work as the head of information security @ [Solutionlab](https://solutionlab.net/ "A dev agency in Lithuania.").

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stigkas/ "Stelios' LinkedIn account.") says that I am a certified necromancer, but this is only partially true: my certification has expired.

### What hardware do you use?

I have a Dell laptop that my old job let me keep. I don't even know what the model is and I am not bothered to check. I drive a [Raleigh Revenio 1.0 bike][revenio-1.0], and use a [Nokia 3310][3310], and a micro wallet.

### And what software?

I use [MOC][] for playing music, [mpv][] for videos, [Audacity][] for sound editing, [Wireshark][] for network sniffing, [Stellarium][] for space exploration, [Burp][] Proxy for web application testing, [Brave][] for browsing, [Jaxx][] as a blockchain wallet, and [Anki][] for 中文 learning.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd like to use only open-source hardware and software, without the need to authenticate anywhere, in a universe with [universal health coverage](https://www.uhc2030.org/ "A collaborative platform for working towards universal healthcare."), [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income "The Wikipedia entry for universal basic income.") and [meaningful universal connectivity](https://www.broadbandcommission.org/universal-connectivity/ "A commission helping to guide international broadband policy and development.").
