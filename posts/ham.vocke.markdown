### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Ham](https://www.hamvocke.com/ "Ham's website."). I'm a software developer from Germany. I work for [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] where I help build [Stack Overflow for Teams][stack-overflow-for-teams]. Think of it as your private version of Stack Overflow where you can discuss all the stuff that's relevant to you and your team.

Previously, I've been a consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com/ "A software consultancy."), have written a thing about [software testing](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html "Ham's post about the software test pyramid.") and a few articles about [tmux](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/ "Ham's post about tmux."), a tool to manage terminal sessions.

I enjoy programming but value my time far away from computers, too. When I'm not working on any pet projects, I try to spent time in nature with my dog Lenny and my wife.

### What hardware do you use?

For the past 7 years, I've been using Mac hardware for anything that's paying the bills - mostly because that's what my employers gave me. Right now I use a [15-inch 2019 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] to build Stack Overflow.

For my private shenanigans, I don't need the latest and greatest, nor do I need super beefy hardware. I prefer solid and long-living hardware and try to use it until it fails. I use a [2020 Dell XPS 13 9300][xps-13-9300] that I just bought to replace my old [2013 XPS 13][xps-13] that I cherished until parts failed and it couldn't keep up anymore.

Stack Overflow gives remote employees a quite generous budget to build out their office. This allowed me to splurge on office furniture and peripherals I use to get work done: A [34-inch Dell UltraSharp monitor][u3419w] that's attached to my [Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk][jarvis-bamboo]. Then there's a [Herman Miller Aeron chair][aeron] for, well... sitting. 100% of my bugs are typed on a [Vortex Tab75][tab75] keyboard with Cherry MX brown switches. I've got a [Logitech MX Master 2S][mx-master-2s] that I'm quite fond of.

I own a pair of [Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones][quietcomfort-25] that I bought mostly for my previous consulting job. Noise cancelling makes a difference if you're travelling and sitting in noisy offices a lot and I like the no-frills reliability of a simple headphone jack (and I find that Bluetooth sets often sound horrible - don't they?).

I read books on a [Kindle Paperwhite][kindle-paperwhite]. I hate the Amazon tie-in but I love the comfort of a small device that carries a gazillion books and has a pleasant e-ink display.

I don't like spending an outrageous amount of money for my phones and I'm aiming for a good bang for my buck. Right now, I'm using a [OnePlus Nord][nord] and before that I've used the [OnePlus 3T][3t], the [OnePlus One][one.2] and even earlier phones from Google's Nexus line (RIP).

### And what software?

I've been a Linux person since 2005 and learned to love the beauty and versatility of command line tools. I most often default to [Ubuntu][] as the pragmatic choice and have used [Arch Linux][arch-linux] whenever I felt like I got too much free time. I'd probably use Linux for work if it didn't make our IT support's lives harder, and so I've grown used to use [macOS][] on the MacBooks my employers gave me. While macOS is not my preferred choice I'd take it over working in a Windows environment any day - [WSL][windows-subsystem-for-linux] is not enough to convince me.

[Alacritty][] is my terminal emulator but I don't have a strong opinion on this one. I often use [tmux][] to manage my terminal sessions, unless I can use a proper tiling window manager - [i3][] being my favorite here.

My editors are vim and [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code]. I use [vim][] for working on small programming tasks and long-form writing and switch over to VS Code as my code grows larger.

For really large codebases and serious work (unlike the fun stuff I do in my free time) I'm a die-hard user of JetBrains' products. I use [Rider][] to work on Stack Overflow (we're using [C#][c-sharp] and [ASP.NET][] on .NET Core) and have used [IntelliJ IDEA][intellij-idea] extensively in the past.

To organize my workdays, I use a vim plugin called [vimwiki][]. This allows me to keep notes in a plain text format and more importantly makes it super easy to write a diary. Each morning, I grab a coffee and take 10 minutes to write a new diary entry where I reflect on the day before and write down a list of all the things I want to do.

I use [Firefox][] for all my web browsing and web development since I strongly believe that we need more than Google, Microsoft and Apple dominating everything they touch.

My passwords are stored in [Bitwarden][]. I use [CircleCI][] for my build pipelines, [Jekyll][] for my blog, [DigitalOcean][] and [Netlify][] for my infrastructure.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm easy to please but I do have a soft spot for things that last long and are reliable.

During my time as a consultant I learned that I can get work done with just a laptop and any place to sit, however I vastly appreciate a dedicated workspace that's not trying to break your spine.

In times of escapism I dream of a cabin by a lake with a good internet connection, a large wooden desk with a laptop (running Linux for sure), a big monitor and a decent keyboard, and a comfy couch to unwind. That'd be sweet.
