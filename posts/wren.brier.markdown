### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Wren Brier](http://www.wrenegade.info/ "Wren's website.") and I'm the creative director of the game [Unpacking][]. As an indie I wear a lot of hats, but my main skills are pixel art, UX/UI, and art direction. I also dabble in production, level design and bizdev.

### What hardware do you use?

Oh no, I'm bad at this part. I use a PC running [Windows 11][windows-11] and as of recently, an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro]. Up until recently I also used a [MacBook][], but it's on its last legs. For drawing I alternate between using a [Wacom Intuos Pro drawing tablet][intuos-pro] and a [SteelSeries Rival 3 mouse][rival-3], depending on what scale I'm working at and how straight or fluid my lines need to be. I have two monitors and a sit-stand desk.

### And what software?

For game development I use [Unity][]. For pixel art I use [Aseprite][] and for most other art I use [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop]. For communicating with my team I use [Discord][] and for version control we use [Perforce][].

### What would be your dream setup?

Having my own office (I currently share one with my partner, we work back to back!) and a big [Wacom Cintiq tablet][cintiq]. Currently it wouldn't fit! I would also really like some aircon in the office.
