### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name's Toby Alden, and I'm a programmer. I mostly make games and websites, which you can find links to at [tobyalden.com](https://tobyalden.com/ "Toby's website."). I'm currently working on a horror platformer called Love Eternal, which you can follow the development of [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LoveEternalGame "The Love Eternal Twitter account.").

### What hardware do you use?

I use a 2013 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. I have tendonitis in both wrists, so ergonomics is very important to me. I work standing, using an 23.5-inch monitor I got off [Craigslist][] for 40 bucks (a [Dell SE2416H][se2416h]). For a keyboard, I use the [Kinesis Advantage2][advantage2], a funky ergonomic keyboard where the keys are inset in small bowls. It's a bit pricey, but it's helped a lot with the pain in my wrists. For a mouse, I use a wired Anker vertical mouse. These are pretty cheap, and a great investment if you use the mouse a lot. The vertical shape puts your hand in a "handshake" position that feels a lot more natural than a standard mouse. I have everything stacked on boxes to get the monitor at eye level and the keyboard and mouse at a height where my forearms are parallel to the ground while I'm using it. I try to work in increments of 25 minutes, with a five minute break between each one to avoid straining my body.

### And what software?

For coding, I use [Vim][] and a Unix shell. I like to work in pure code as much as possible, so I try to use small, code-centric frameworks instead of larger development tools with integrated IDEs like [Unity][] or [Unreal][unreal-engine]. For games, I usually code in [Haxe][] using a framework called [HaxePunk][], although I've also been experimenting with [Lua][] and [LÃ–VE][love] recently. For websites, I typically use [Node.js][] or just plain [JavaScript][]. Other tools I use for games include [Ableton Live 10][live] (for music and sound effects), [Acorn][] (an image editor), and [OGMO Editor][ogmo-editor] (an open source map editor).

### What would be your dream setup?

I don't really have a dream setup - the process I have now feels pretty ideal. If there's anything I would change, it would just be to make HaxePunk an active project with a community around it. I enjoy working in it the most of any framework I've tried, but there hasn't been any new development on it for a while and not too many people use it, so its fate is uncertain.
