### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Gris Grimly](http://madcreator.com/ "Gris' website."). I'm an author and illustrator who works primarily in children and young adult publishing. Sometimes I design characters and develop concepts for film and television.

### What hardware do you use?

My media of choice is watercolor. I use watercolor pigments and gouache by Holbein, 140lb cold press natural white paper by Arches, and sepia inks by Daler Rowney.

I use an old [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] from 2012. I will use it until it dies. I use an old [iPhone 5][iphone-5] from 2012 as well. I will use it until it dies.

### And what software?

I use [Microsoft Word][word] to write. I use [Image Capture][image-capture] to scan my watercolor paintings and [Photoshop][] to color correct the files for my own archival purposes. For publication, all of my artwork is shipped to the publishers for photography and design, so I don't usually have a hand in the final output. If it is a personal project or merchandise endeavor, I will do layouts, design, and color separations in Photoshop as well, but my digital use is very minimal.

### What would be your dream setup?

I would like to work out of a barn in rural Nebraska. An upstairs loft would be a painting studio with record player and computer desk for a large scanner. Maybe I would get a [Cintiq][] and learn something new. On the bottom floor would be a library and storage for framed and unframed paintings. The walls would be graced with religious items, taxidermy and antiques.
