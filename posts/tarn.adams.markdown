### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Tarn Adams, and I make computer games with my brother. [Bay 12 Games](http://bay12games.com/ "Tarn's game company website.") is our website, and the game we are most known for is [Dwarf Fortress][dwarf-fortress].

### What hardware do you use?

The computer I do everything on is my Toshiba [Satellite P55T-C5114][satellite-p55t-c5114] laptop, and I also have a [Mac Mini][mac-mini] which I use for porting Dwarf Fortress. I have an Insignia mouse I can attach to the laptop when I get tired of using the little finger mousepad... so it's always plugged in!

When I need to talk to somebody online or record something, I have a Turtle Beach headset. My most recent cellphone is a [iPhone 8][iphone-8], which I got after dipping my Samsung in the Pacific Ocean by accident.

I have a [PS4][] and a [Switch][switch.2].

### And what software?

My main operating system is [Windows 10][windows-10], and I use [Mac OS X][macos] and [Ubuntu][] for porting. All of my game programming is done in [C++][c-plusplus] using Microsoft [Visual Studio Community][visual-studio-community], though I have some helpful utilities that use [Python][] 2.5. I gather there are very newer Pythons, but 2.5 is the most recent compatible one with the scripts. I use OpenGL and SDL for graphics -- the upside is their portability. I use an older free version of [FMOD][] for sound, though that'll change now that Dwarf Fortress is going to [Steam][] and [itch][itch.io].

I do all of my text editing in [WordPad][] and [Notepad][], depending on how ugly the line breaks look when I open up the file. I use [Paint][] to crop screenshots and whatever else I need to do.

I mostly do interviews and things over [Skype][], though they have other sites they use sometimes now. I use [Audacity][] and [Open Broadcaster][obs-studio] when I need to work with audio or video, though that hardly ever comes up for work these days.

For the website, I use the pad programs to do all the HTML. The website has a [Simple Machines Forum][simple-machines-forum] as well as a [Mantis][] bug tracker to track all of the issues with the game. I move things to and from the website with [FileZilla][]. I currently host Bay 12 Games with [Linode][] and Lunar Pages. I use [PuTTY][] to log in to and mess with my servers.

I listen to music pretty much non-stop, and it'll either be on [Spotify][] or using [Winamp][].

I use [Gmail][] and the [7-Zip][] compression utility.

### What would be your dream setup?

I always end up getting fairly inexpensive replacement computers and not really missing anything, so I don't think I have a dream hardware setup. The only thing I find myself thinking about at times is a really good music sequencer. For a brief time some years ago, I had [Ableton][live] and was super happy with it, but I never ended up using my tracks for anything and didn't renew my license when that old computer died.
