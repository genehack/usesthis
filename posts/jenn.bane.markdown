### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Jenn](http://www.jennbane.com/ "Jenn's website.")! I live in Chicago, IL. I'm the community lead behind [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/ "The card game.") and our new company, [Blackbox](http://www.blackbox.cool/ "A shipping company.").

My job is hard to explain. My main focuses are philanthropy and making jokes on the Internet. More broadly, that's community building, playtesting, copywriting, editing, and advertising. I help build campaigns like our [holiday promotions](https://www.eightsensiblegifts.com/ "Cards Against Humanity's hannukah gifts.") and scheme silly pranks, like the time [we sent poop in the mail](http://blog.maxistentialism.com/post/105481561063/black-friday-bullshit-this-year-for-black "Max's post about their Black Friday Bullshit campaign.") to a bunch of people for Black Friday.

I also organize the [Science Ambassador Scholarship](http://www.scienceambassadorscholarship.org/ "Cards Against Humanity's science scholarship.") for women, and I co-host a podcast called [Friendshipping](https://friendshipping.simplecast.fm/ "Jenn and Trinn's podcast.") about friendship and mental health.

### What hardware do you use?

I love my 13" [MacBook Air][macbook-air]. She has never let me down even though I've dropped her a dozen times.  I also use an [Apple Thunderbolt Display monitor][thunderbolt-display].

To record Friendshipping, we use the studio recording spaces in our office. It houses six [Shure SM7B microphones][sm7b] with [Cloudlifter CL-1 preamps][cloudlifter-cl-1], and an [Allen & Heath 16:2 Mixwizard mixing board][mixwizard-wz4-16-2] connected to an [iMac][]. We use a [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2][scarlett-2i2] to bring in [Skype][] calls. In our smaller studio, we have four [Shure Beta 87A microphones][beta-87a] with a [Tascam US-2x2][us-2x2] that works with any Apple Computer.

I need to include that I'm not qualified to touch any of these things, and I would be nowhere without our amazing producer, [Alex Cox](https://twitter.com/alexcox "Alexandra's Twitter account.").

### And what software?

[Slack][] for team communication, [Basecamp][] for project management, [TextExpander][] for making email as efficient as possible. I also use [iA Writer][ia-writer] to write without distraction, [CleanMyMac][] for upkeep, [1Password][] for security, and recently we've been trying out [Front][] for answering Cards Against Humanity support emails.

### What would be your dream setup?

Cards Against Humanity shares a work space in Chicago with the most talented and generous designers, writers, photographers, developers, comedians, teachers, musicians, and podcasters. Our rule for the space is, "if you can teach a skill to someone who wants to learn, you do it." We often just quit working to play games together and we cook meals for one each other all the time. I feel very, very lucky to already be living my dream setup.

For the days I'm feeling introverted and sick of the Internet, though, I wouldn't mind a bungalow on an island somewhere.
