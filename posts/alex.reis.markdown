### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Alex](https://www.alexries.com/ "Alex's website."), a concept artist and illustrator living in Melbourne, Australia, who grew up on a farm surrounded by animals and plenty of open space. After moving to the city and studying Creative Arts, I started working in video games as a concept artist, and later diversified into illustration as well. All the while I chipped away at my personal 'birrin' world-building project.

### What hardware do you use?

I am basically exclusively PC now. My system stats are: [Windows 10 Pro][windows-10-pro] on an [Intel i7-10700KF CPU][core-i7-10700kf] @ 3.80GHz. I have a few HDs, some solid state and some platter (the latter for long term storage), I run dual monitors, both Dell: the primary is a [P2715Q][] while the secondary is my old [2408WFP][]. My graphics card is an [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER][geforce-rtx-2080-super] and I have 32GB of RAM. My mouse and keyboard are low end, and I use a large size [Wacom Intuos Pro tablet][intuos-pro].

### And what software?

My primary software is [Photoshop][], and I make 3D assets as needed in [Blender][], which I am slowly learning.

### What would be your dream setup?

I am close to my ideal now: essentially I would just add more power. I have no desire for a [Cintiq][], as my Intuos allows me to sit up straight and keep my screen free, rather then being hunched over it.
 
My one wish would be that the program [Procreate][procreate-ios] was made available on PC or at least Android, as its brush engine is unmatched.
