### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name's [Duncan Shotton](https://dshott.co.uk/ "Duncan's website."), I'm a British designer, artist and inventor. The aim of my work is to "embed happiness into things". I use themes such as play, wit and illusion to create tools and objects that converge simple ideas with serious product design. My most popular works are "[Rainbow Pencils](https://dshott.co.uk/rainbow "Duncan's rainbow pencils.")" - pencils that make a rainbow every time you sharpen them, and then maybe "[Soy Shape('s)](https://dshott.co.uk/product/soy/ "Duncan's soy sauce dipping dishes.")" - dipping dishes that arrange soy sauce at different depths to create the illusion of impossible 3D geometry.

I've done some [PechaKucha talks](https://www.pechakucha.com/users/duncan-shotton "Duncan's PechaKucha account."), and my favourite works are my [Digimech Clock](https://dshott.co.uk/digimech "Duncan's electromagnetic clock.") and [Remote Control Pop Up Shop](https://dshott.co.uk/rc-shop "Duncan's tiny remotes controlled pop up shop.").

### What would be your dream setup?

Would be great to have a better DSLR camera and an edelkrone slider. I'd love a better workshop: a laser cutter, a CNC machine (like a Roland [MDX-50][modela-mdx-50] or [SRM-20][monofab-srm-20]), Formlabs [Form 3 3D printer][form-3] with associated curing/cleaning stations, a Myford Super 7 metal lathe, a vinyl cutter, a sandblaster, tip top extraction..

Perhaps I could also request that the workshop have one wall of bullet/scratch/dust/flith-proof glass, and on the other side there be a white garage space with a fine running perfect [88 Honda CR-X][cr-x] in dark grey.

Always wanted to have a design studio inside a matt black ice-cream truck too... ^^
