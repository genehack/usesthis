### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm an independent video game developer. I've been making games as [Popcannibal](https://twitter.com/popcannibal "Ziba's Twitter account.") since 2010. Like these ones about [seating arrangements][girls-like-robots], writing poetry, [building boats][make-sail] and [sending nice letters to people][kind-words]. I do all this in Boston, where there's a really great [indie video game scene](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/bostongamedev/ "The Boston GameDev meetup."). One of the elements of my life that keeps me sane are my co-workers/friends/support group in the [Indie Game Collective](http://www.indiegamecollective.org/ "A coworking space for indie game developers in Boston."). I've also published over [1,500 slot machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Lhqri8tZk "A YouTube video of Ziba and Alex Schwartz's GDC talk on app stores.").

### What hardware do you use?

I keep my main development hardware updated on about a 3 year cycle, but I keep a lot of slower machines handy for performance testing my games on a good range of specs.

My desktop is an [i7-4770K][core-i7-4770k], 16GB RAM, terabyte SSD, [GTX 980][geforce-gtx-980].

My main laptop is similar with a 4K screen, NVMe storage, and a [1070][geforce-gtx-1070] GPU.

I'm also rocking 3 [Mac Minis][mac-mini] and a 6 year old $500 laptop that's mostly good for web development.

My [Surface Pro 2][surface-pro-2] gets way more use than it should for a tablet its age, but it's A) pretty solid and B) what I've decided is the current minimum specification for my games to run on.

### And what software?

I try to be comfortable developing in every environment that I sell my games on. I am constantly switching between [Windows 10][windows-10] and Linux ([Debian][] and [Ubuntu][]). I fire up a Mac for special occasions. 

Most of my games were developed using the [Unity][] game engine.

For coding, I'll switch between [Visual Studio][visual-studio], [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code], [MonoDevelop][] and JetBrains [Rider][] every day.

I use [Vim][] regularly when I work on my websites and some game backend stuff in [PHP][]. Yes, PHP is still cool.

I use [Git][] for code with [Git LFS][git-large-file-storage] because game assets can be sizeable.

I use [Resilio Sync][resilio-sync], for synchronizing non-code, file storage across my computers. It functions like [Dropbox][] but it's decentralized and uses the BitTorrent protocol.

[Gimp][] for modest alterations the game assets that my artist provides.

[Blender][] for editing all my game trailers. Blender is a surprisingly capable video editor.

[ShareX][] for capturing gifs to showcase works in progress.

[Trello][] and [OneNote][] for quickly capturing ideas.

I've also rigged several of my games to dump in-game feedback directly to their own Trello pages.

### What would be your dream setup?

Debian all day, everyday. All open source. No monitors, just a VR helmet with perfect comfort and clarity. No traditional keyboard or mouse; something more like the [AlphaGrip][igrip].
