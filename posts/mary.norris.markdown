### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Mary Norris](http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mary-norris "Mary's page on The New Yorker's site."), and I am a copy editor. I work at The New Yorker, putting commas in and taking commas out. Thirty years of hard labor! I am also a writer, and no one is more surprised than I am that I got a book out of my day job. [_BETWEEN YOU AND ME: CONFESSIONS OF A COMMA QUEEN_](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Between-You--Me/ "Mary's book page.") is a manual for copy editors cleverly disguised as a riotous personal history, studded with New Yorker anecdotes.

### What hardware do you use?

I use pencils, mostly Blackwings, usually the [Palomino Blackwing 602][blackwing-602] ("Half the pressure, twice the speed"). There is a new all-black Blackwing ([the 24][blackwing-24]), a white one ([the Pearl][blackwing-pearl]), and the classic [Blackwing][], which has the softest lead. The pencils aren't graded by the standard American (1,2,3) system or European (HB) system, but they all glide instead of scratch. I also like the [Ticonderoga Noir][ticonderoga-noir]. I use a long-point sharpener suitable for the classroom ([the Angel-5][angel-5]). Someone recently gave me a very classy limited-edition Caran d'Ache sharpener, which doesn't give quite as long a point as I like. I avoid mechanical pencils and electric pencil sharpeners.

I also use a Mac desktop at work and a Mac laptop at home. I am terrible at keeping the screen clean. I don't know any more about the computers than I have to know.

### And what software?

Black coffee.

### What would be your dream setup?

Because so much of my work is reading from a computer screen or a page proof approximately ten inches from my eyes, my ideal is a desk with a view of the ocean (preferably panoramic). I made the final revisions on my book one summer while I was commuting to work on a ferry. It was heaven. I'd grab a table inside on the upper deck, or a window seat with a flop-down tray-table, sip a cup of coffee, and copy-edit my own manuscript. It was like having a floating office with a view of New York Harbor.
