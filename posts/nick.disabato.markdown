### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Nick Disabato, although most folks call me [nickd](http://nickd.org "Nick's website."). I'm a designer and publisher from Chicago, which is the best city in the world. I have very curly hair. I'm probably most known for making [*Cadence & Slang*](http://cadence.cc "Nick's interaction design book."), a very small book about interaction design, which was one of Kickstarter's earliest projects. Now I edit, design, and publish [*Distance*](http://distance.cc "Nick's quarterly journal."), a quarterly journal with long essays about the "why"s of our field. I also have sideburns.

### What hardware do you use?

I can't get any work done in my apartment: too many distractions. So for coffee shops and coworking spaces, I use a 13" [MacBook Air][macbook-air], the generation before the one that got Thunderbolt. I use an [iPhone 4][iphone-4] and an [iPad 1][ipad]; [I don't care much for the latest and greatest](http://lastyearsmodel.org/ "A website for saving the planet through sheer laziness."), and [I set them on airplane mode pretty often](http://thedata.cc/post/4730535558/airplane-mode "Nick's post about Airplane Mode.").

I also have an old [iMac][] from around 2008 that I use as a server and "home base" of sorts. It's connected to a crummy $80 Brother laser printer that doesn't do duplex, a [Drobo][] with four 2TB hard drives for archival, and an [Epson Perfection v500][perfection-v500] for scanning stuff. I use an [AirPort Extreme][airport-extreme] and [AirPort Express][airport-express] for wifi; the latter is necessary because [our](http://www.torridly.org/ "Erin's website.") apartment is long and narrow, and the signal from the front doesn't reach the back very well.

As input devices go, I use a barely-working [Logitech MX Revolution][mx-revolution] and an [Apple Bluetooth Keyboard][keyboard], which I occasionally take out of the house when I want to focus on long-form writing with my iPad or iPhone.

I have used the same kind of pen, a [black Uniball Vision Fine 0.7][vision-fine-0.7], since 1998. I have been through several dozen of these. I will probably write with the same kind of pen until the day I die. Every passionate person has something that they'll stockpile if they ever hear of its being discontinued, and this pen is my thing.

I write in Field Notes these days, but I'll admit that I'm too sensitive to the material properties of books to be satisfied with any notebook that I didn't spec out myself. The paper stock isn't thick or smooth enough, but I'm fond of having a brown grid. I wish I could write with my Uniball and the ink would dry well on silk finish, but that's probably a pipe dream. So for me, Field Notes are the best ones out there -- and I'm happy to support something that's designed in Chicago.

I get around most places on my bike, at least when the weather isn't [lousy](http://www.life.com/gallery/55531/image/108758590/chicagos-insane-blizzard-2011 "An article about Chicago's blizzard of 2011."). I built it up in 2009 so I could teach myself about bike maintenance. It's a Soma Rush frame with straight Nitto bars chopped to my shoulder width, a Sugino KyotoLOCO crank, and a White Industries freewheel cog that will probably outlast me. (I want a [Thunder Horn][thunder-horn] to blare at cars, but if we're being honest with ourselves, 115 dB isn't loud enough.) (And no, I don't want to ride fixed. I like having kneecaps.)

### And what software?

On my iOS devices, I use [Echofon][echofon-ios] and [Birdbrain][birdbrain-ios] for accessing Twitter. I replaced my weather client with Shine and I tend to use [Soulver][soulver-ios] instead of the built-in calculator. [Instagram][instagram-ios] for sharing and discussing mundane photos. [iA Writer][ia-writer-ios] is invaluable for long-form writing with a Bluetooth keyboard. I use [Verbs][verbs-ios] with push notifications for IMing, especially when collaborating so frequently with my authors over [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Pages][] before major deadlines. I use [Reeder][reeder-ios] for RSS, but I don't follow more than a couple dozen feeds. [Simplenote][simplenote-ios] and [Listary][listary-ios] are my favorite apps for note-taking and todo lists; they work very elegantly, especially with each other. And for real-time, GPS-based tracking of exactly how broken the CTA is, there's [Buster][buster-ios].

On my Mac, I (very grudgingly) use [InDesign][] to typeset books, [iA Writer][ia-writer] for long-form writing, [BBEdit][] and [Coda][] for web development stuff, [Safari][] for primary browsing, [iTunes][] for music, [nvALT][] to write notes and short-form stuff (including this!), [Apple Mail][mail] with the [SpamSieve][] plugin, [Adium][] for chat, [Transmit][] for FTP, [OmniGraffle][] and [OmniOutliner][] for interaction design projects, [LittleSnapper][] for big screenshots of long web pages, and [F.lux][] for controlling my monitor's color temperature.

It's clich√© to say at this point, but cloud services have been tremendously useful for me. Listary and Simplenote sync with nvALT on my two computers and iOS devices, and I use [CloudApp][] to share most content, especially images of various interfaces. (I use [Cloud2go][cloud2go-ios] on my iPhone to post to CloudApp.) I use RSS only on iOS devices, so haven't played with Reeder for Mac much. I use Echofon on every single platform, and I have unread items sync between everything while [stridently filtering peripheral clients](http://thedata.cc/post/13209321061/filtering "Nick's post on filtering."). [Dropbox][] for syncing the kitchen sink. And finally, I send nearly everything to [Instapaper][] these days; it remains a no-hyperbole life-altering app, one that has caused me to read more than I ever have before.

### What would be your dream setup?

A fast bike, no traffic, no headwind, a bonfire from salvaged alley wood, one or two nice beers, and good conversations with smart, kind people. I can't help the headwind or the traffic, but I'm always working on everything else.
