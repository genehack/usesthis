### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm the Founder and CEO of [Framework](https://frame.work/ "A hardware company."), and I'm on a mission to remake consumer electronics to respect people and the planet. Specifically, I started Framework to build products that last longer by making them easy to repair and upgrade. We're just over three years in, and making great progress!

### What hardware do you use?

This is an easy one. I use hardware that we make. Usually, I'm dogfooding whichever product we're going to launch next. Currently, I'm switching back and forth between a [Framework Laptop 13][laptop-13-amd] (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series) and a [Framework Laptop 16][laptop-16-amd].

Aside from laptops, I currently use an [iPhone 12][iphone-12] that has at least one repair using replacement parts from iFixit. I spent three years as an Engineer at Apple, so I'm stuck on iPhones by habit. I started and led the hardware team at Oculus. [Oculus Quest 2][quest-2] was the last product I led the architecture of before leaving to start Framework, and that is another device I use regularly. My current favorite headphones are [Bushmills x Grado][bushmills-x-grado], made from old whisky barrels.

Apart from gadgets, there are some hardware tools I like and use regularly. Mitutoyo calipers, a Fluke multimeter, a dirt cheap Rigol oscilloscope, a Pace soldering station, and a [Prusa MK3 3D printer][i3-mk3s-plus].

### And what software?

Currently, I'm mostly using software that doesn't bring me joy. Because most of the engineers in Framework run [Ubuntu][], [Fedora][], or [NixOS][], I'm doing my dogfooding on [Windows 11][windows-11]. I spend most of my time in various parts of [Google Workspace][google-workspace] these days, but occasionally I get to have fun in [OpenSCAD][] and [KiCAD][] making open source hardware reference designs for modules.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm fortunate to be in a position where it doesn't have to be a dream! We started with laptops, but our vision is to bring this mission to all of consumer electronics, one category at a time. I can't share what those are just yet, but you can imagine some of the categories I mentioned in the second question being there.
