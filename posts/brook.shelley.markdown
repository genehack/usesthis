### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Brook Shelley, and I am a Senior Partner Engineer at [Slack][]. I work with our awesome Platform team to help companies build apps that [integrate with Slack](https://api.slack.com/ "The Slack API documentation."). My roommate is a cat named [Snorri Sturluson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorri_Sturluson "The Wikipedia entry for Snorri Sturluson."), and [he](https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1073110153279418368 "A tweeted photo of Snorri.") [is](https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1072377467460116489 "Another tweeted photo of Snorri.") [cute](https://twitter.com/brookshelley/status/1066808258931773440 "A third tweeted photo of Snorri."). I also write on [my own site](https://brookshelley.com/ "Brook's website."), and cook a lot. Sometimes I powerlift at Max's. I live [near an IKEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeryville,_California "The Wikipedia entry for Emeryville, California."), which I try not to go to every week.

### What hardware do you use?

At work I have a [2018 13" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that I use in clamshell mode at my desk, with a large LG monitor, a [Apple Magic Trackpad][magic-trackpad], and a [Microsoft Sculpt keyboard][sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard] that ideally keeps me from having wrist pain. Thanks ergonomics folks! My Mac is one with the Touch Bar, and honestly, it's fine. I hope one day my Mac gets Face ID though. Music goes to my [ATH headphones][ath-m40x] or my [AirPods][], depending on if I'm at my desk. I like the switch to USB-C, and always have a [YubiKey][] in one of my four ports, as well as a USB-C -> USB-C cable to charge my personal [2018 iPad Pro 11"][ipad-pro]. I went with 256gb of storage and WiFi on my iPad, though now that I use [Google Fi][google-fi], I kind of wish I had the cellular model to take advantage of their free data-only sims. I've got a [space grey iPhone XS 64gb][iphone-xs] that I use to listen to podcasts and music, or keep up on [Twitter][tweetbot].

When I'm at home or on the bus, I primarily use this iPad with a [keyboard attached][smart-keyboard], and use cloud services to handle things I [previously hosted][plex] at home. The flexibility of a handheld touchscreen that becomes a pseudo-notebook is really great, and the iPad just feels _fast_. There's a few things I can't do on an iPad, but largely I've worked-around them, or offloaded those tasks.

I have an [Apple TV][apple-tv], a Samsung Plasma (that the Wirecutter recommended years ago), and a [few][switch.2] [consoles][ps4]. Most of the time I forget I have video games, and watch [Swedish mysteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordskott "The Wikipedia entry for Jordskott.") or [dark comedies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EXfNhReicY "A trailer for Patriot on YouTube."). My oldest hobby is reading, and I use a [fancy schmacy Kindle][kindle-oasis] for that. It's waterproof, which means I can read in the bath, or in the sauna. Also, I'm clumsy and I've dropped Kindles in the toilet before (don't @ me), so everything I own needs to be vaguely waterproof. A notable exception to this rule are my [Lamy Safari fountain pen][safari-fountain-pen], and my Hobonichi Techo. I use my Techo to keep a log of my day, with various datapoints like how I'm feeling, what I ate, and how I slept, and a fountain pen makes me feel fancy when I'm writing. I carry my iPad and notebook to work every day in a [rotation](https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2018/10/04/dsptch-waist-bag.html "Brook's review of the DSPTCH waist bag.") of [bags](https://www.brookshelley.com/blog/2018/05/17/review-invisible-one-mini.html "Brook's review of the Invisible One Mini bag."). I cook in two [Lodge cast iron pans][10.25-inch-cast-iron-skillet] because they're bombproof, and its rewarding to slowly build a patina with repeated bacon cooking. Morning coffee (Ethiopian single-origin) comes via a [Hario burr grinder][v60-electric-coffee-grinder], and a [Chemex][three-cup-classic], then lives in a Zojirushi travel mug.

### And what software?

I live in Slack whether I'm at work or at home. I run a small social Slack, and am part of a [few others](https://2018.xoxofest.com "The XOXO festival in Portland, Oregon."). I do most of my writing in [iA Writer][ia-writer], and push it to [GitHub Pages][github-pages]/[Jekyll][] with [Working Copy][working-copy-ios] on my iPad or iPhone. I code in [Atom][] or in [Glitch][glitch.3] on my Mac or iPad, respectively. The rare email goes through [Spark][spark.2], and I keep up with websites via [RSS on Fiery Feeds][fiery-feeds-ios] backed by [Feedbin][]. Podcasts live in [Overcast][overcast-ios], and all of my todos live in [Things][], which has a spectacular dark mode. I listen to music on [Apple Music][apple-music], mostly because I wanted [metal](https://daxma.bandcamp.com/ "Daxma's Bandcamp page.") on my watch for the gym. I'm a big fan of [Safari][], and use its Reading List in lieu of a read-it-later app. If I lost [1Password][] I'd probably cry. I love using it for multi-factor authentication as well. I take occasional notes in [Bear][], or in a Field Notes memo book that was XOXO Festival swag. I know where to go during the day because my [Apple Watch 4][apple-watch-series-4] tells me via [Fantastical][]. If something isn't on my calendar, it's not real.

### What would be your dream setup?

Honestly, I'm pretty happy hardware-wise with what I use right now. It's likely I'll upgrade my iPhone in the fall, as is my custom, but my iPad and work computer are both outstanding. Ideally I wouldn't have wrist pain ever, and could happily work on the Smart Keyboard, or something equally portable too. I _do_ want a better calendar app, because Fantastical is kinda wonky on my iPad, and [Timepage][timepage-ios] doesn't have new Apple Watch updates. Maybe one day [Google Calendar][google-calendar] will remember Apple makes a watch, but I doubt it. I'd _love_ Atom on my iPad, and the ability to seamlessly use my iPad on a big screen, then take it to meetings. I already use all my macOS apps at work in fullscreen mode, so going all-in on iOS isn't much of a leap. I hope Apple makes AirPods with passive noise-cancelling soon, because the bus can be loud. Generally, we live in a wild future that is full of gadgets and gizmos that make life easier, but I also wish we had healthcare for everyone, living wages, and affordable housing.
