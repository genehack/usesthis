### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Dr Aleks Krotoski](http://alekskrotoski.com/ "Aleks' website."). I'm a psychologist and journalist, though I make my money from the latter. I present and produce radio programmes for broadcasters around the world, including BBC Radio 4 (the long-running Digital Human series) and BBC World Service.

### What hardware do you use?

I'm a laptop lady, though my house is full of robots and automated thingies.

When I say thingies, I mean the lights, the heat, the door, the audio system. All of it is voice activated. Most of the names I can't remember or are changed when I'm not looking, so I can't do any of these things. I also have a [Loomo][] and other redundant AI bots kicking around too. This happens when you live with a futurist!

### And what software?

I'm pretty vanilla - the most exciting software I use is probably [SelfControl][], an oldie but a goodie. It stops me from being distracted by the usual web culprits when I'm trying to write a book in [Scrivener][].

### What would be your dream setup?

Desert island, soft breezes, lots of cultural institutions a short walk away... and probably what I have now in terms of double monitor, fast Mac and a big room to work in. Also, a standing desk. Very important.
