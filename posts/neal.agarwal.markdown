### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Neal Agarwal and I spend most of my time working on [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/ "Neal's website."). It's a site where each page is a different creative exploration. Popular pages on the site include one that lets you [spend Bill Gates' money](https://neal.fun/spend/ "Neal's project about spending Bill Gates' money.") and another one that gives an [interactive view into the universe](https://neal.fun/size-of-space/ "Neal's project about the size of space."). I also post weird web experiments [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal "Neal's Twitter account.") and run a site called [Just For Fun](https://justforfun.io/ "Neal's showcase of fun creative web projects.") that features creative projects on the web.

### What hardware do you use?

I have a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (15-inch) and a pre-built desktop that I should probably replace. I'm not really much of a hardware guy so I just get what everyone else says to get. 

I usually don't fall-in-love with physical products, but the exceptions are my [iPhone XS][iphone-xs], my Panasonic [Earbuds][rp-hje120] and my Buffway wallet.

I also have:

- Logitech mouse/keyboard.
- 1 monitor setup (like a caveman, I know).
- A fidget spinner that helps me debug (way better than ducks imo).

### And what software?

For coding I use [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code] and primarily [Chrome][] during development. I use [Photoshop][] and [Illustrator][] for making designs/mockups. Recently I came across photopea.com and I love using that instead of Photoshop for simple tasks.

I've completely switched to [Notion][] for creating documents and taking notes because it's so good. I'm also listening to [Spotify][] pretty much all day. To record my silly Twitter videos I use [Bandicam][] and [GifCam][]. I use [Pocket][] to save articles/links and the [Kindle][kindle-ios] app on my phone to read all my books. 

In terms of libraries/frameworks, all my websites use a stack of [React][], [Node.js][] and [MongoDB][]. I host pretty much everything on [Netlify][] because it's so easy and I've been a customer for years.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm a minimalist at heart and my dream setup would be the fewest things possible. Ideally my setup would be invisible to me and I could focus entirely on the creative stuff. 

I think I'm getting pretty close to that dream! My only pain point is that I think I'm paying too much for services and the lock-in has me worried. Luckily there seems to be a lot of open-source alternatives out there so I'll start trying those.
