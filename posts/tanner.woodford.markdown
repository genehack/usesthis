### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Tanner Woodford](https://tannerwoodford.com/ "Tanner's website.), founder and executive director of the [Design Museum of Chicago](http://designchicago.org/ "A museum in Chicago."). I believe design has the capacity to fundamentally improve the human condition. In 2012, I opened Chicago's first pop-up design museum as a way to celebrate  the impact of design while making it accessible to everybody. I also teach a class at the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago](http://saic.edu/ "A design school in Chicago.") called "Design Thinking for Social Change," where each student selects a social issue, spends a semester making a research book about it, then tries to make an actual impact by solving a self-identified problem. In the time between these two gigs, [I paint typographic murals](http://tannerwoodford.com/murals/ "Tanner's murals page.").

### What hardware do you use?

Here's a short selection of a long list of hardware I interact with on the daily.

- Drafting table once owned by [Daniel Burnham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham "The Wikipedia entry for Daniel Burnham.")
- 2006 Toyota Corolla Sedan (silver)
- [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (15-inch)
- Apple [iPhone X][iphone-x]
- Silhouette [CAMEO 3][cameo-3] with roll feeder
- #4 Scalpel (#20 blade)
- Sony [MDR-V6][] studio monitor headphones
- Gerber [EAB][] folding pocket knife
- Selection of rulers, t-squares, brushes, and hand tools

### And what software?

In no particular order — [iOS][], [macOS][], [Chrome][], [Slack][], [Baby Connect][baby-connect-ios], [Spotify][], [Overcast][overcast-ios], [Dropbox][], [Drive][google-drive], Hue, [Instagram][instagram-ios], [Gmail][], [IA Writer][ia-writer], [Silhouette Studio][silhouette-studio], [1Password][], [Adobe Suite][creative-suite] ([Illustrator][], [InDesign][], [Photoshop][]), [Keynote][], [Coda][], [WordPress][], [Stripe][], [Square][], [QuickBooks][], [FaceTime][], [SpotHero][spothero-ios], [Google Maps][google-maps-ios], [Sonos][sonos-controller-ios], [Hulu][], and [Netflix][], to name a few.
