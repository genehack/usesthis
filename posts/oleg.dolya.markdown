### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Oleg Dolya, I am a software developer from Moscow, Russia. I make procedural generators of all kinds, but mostly TTRPG and/or cartography related. [Medieval Fantasy City Generator][medieval-fantasy-city-generator] is probably the best-known of them. On my Twitter account I call myself an "indie game developer" which is justified by my six year old roguelike mobile game [Pixel Dungeon][pixel-dungeon].

### What hardware do you use?

I have an [HP Spectre x360 laptop][spectre-x360] (Windows) with an old [Apple Thunderbolt monitor][thunderbolt-display]. It's pretty powerful, but probably because I use it with the closed lid, it overheats all the time. As a result its case is all bent now and I can't take it with me anywhere, the chance of its inner parts falling out is too real. My other laptop is a 2013 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], I use it from time to time for [iOS][] and [macOS][] related tasks. That's another laptop I can't use as a laptop: its battery is virtually dead.

My keyboard is some regular wireless Logitech and my current mouse is [MX Anywhere 2S][mx-anywhere-2s], which is the best mouse I ever had. For drawing I use [Wacom Intuos][intuos] (A5) - not sure what model it is. It's very simple and old.

I don't like to read on screen, so recently I have bought a [Canon PIXMA printer][pixma-mg3640s]. Now my desk is piled with printed documents, articles and TTRPG rules. This is wasteful and probably eco-unfriendly, but more comfortable than reading all the stuff I need to read at my computer.

My current phone is [Google Pixel 3a][pixel-3a]. It was preceded by many other Google phones, Pixels and Nexuses - they don't live long. I have a small collection of old iOS devices which I use for testing my web applications.


### And what software?

Everything I make these days, I make in [Haxe][]. I use [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code] (after migrating from [IDEA][intellij-idea]) for coding and [GitHub][] for version control (although not as consistently as I should). I have an [Adobe Creative Cloud][creative-cloud] subscription of which I only really need [Photoshop][], but occasionally [Illustrator][], [Premiere][] and [Audition][] come in handy as well. For "office" tasks I use [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Slack][].

### What would be your dream setup?

It would be really great to trade my corner in the living room for a real study room. I've been dreaming about a nice plotter or 3D printer or laser cutter, but apart from money all these toys require a proper place for work (a study room!). A more grounded idea is to get a new MacBook to be able to work in a cafe or something like that.
