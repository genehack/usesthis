### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Sebastian Quack](http://sebastianquack.com/ "Sebastian's website."), and I work as an artist and game designer, sometimes as a curator. I create games and run participatory art & urban design projects that happen in-between screens, people and the cities they live in.

### What hardware do you use?

For everyday communication I use a [MacBook Air][macbook-air] and a simple HTC Android phone with dual sim. In projects I use very weird hardware, often mixing low tech and high tech. Non-technical tools like chalk or industrial dunnage bags are great for street games, as well as walkie-talkies, flashlights, MP3 players. Anything that is cheap, robust, simple to use and doesn't break when it falls on pavement. For [audio games in the landscape](https://medium.com/@phantomsynchron/phantom-synchron-soundtrack-einer-stadt-e6bfc03b5110 "Sebastian's post about acoustic exploration games.") I've loved using Minirig speakers.

Everyone has cameras in their phones now, but for quickly equipping players with easy-to-use cameras with preloaded footage, for example when doing video walks, I loved the [Kodak Zi8 pocket camcorder][zi8]. I like working with LEDs and batteries taped together - you can attach them to plastic turtles to play [Turtle Wushu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGRyMkejMxE "A YouTube video explaining how to play Turtle Wushu.") at night. For [drifting](http://driftclub.cc/ "A site dedicated to taking group walks through an urban landscape set to music."), a form of aimless wandering through the city with music, I love using analogue silent disco radio transmitters and headphones. For recording drifts I've used a GoPro.

### And what software?

For browsing, I'm mostly on [Firefox][] or [Chrome][], for documents and spreadsheets I use [Google Drive][google-drive], for coding I use [TextMate][], but any code editor is fine for me. In terms of coding ecosystems, I'm happy with [Ruby][] and [Rails][] and more recently [node.js][] and [Meteor][]. For hosting I like [Heroku][] and [AWS][], but I also have some projects running on [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/ "A web hosting provider."), a German shared hosting provider that gives you a lot of flexibility (and has a pay-as-much-as-you-want model). For graphic work, I've recently discovered [Affinity Designer][affinity-designer], a superb and affordable replacement for [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator]. 

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be truck or a maybe a blimp, boat or a mobile shipping container that moves with me from place to place for projects. Basically a combination of office, makerspace, game design studio, repository of weird equipment for games, library, cooking, caf√© and meeting area. There should be detachable or foldable architectural elements that you can use to transform the space around wherever this thing lands.
