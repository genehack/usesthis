### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Mario von Rickenbach](https://mariov.ch/ "Mario's website."), a digital generalist, game designer, and developer. I often work on games in small teams and create other playful interactive things, often in the context of [Playables](https://playables.net/ "A game studio in Switzerland,"), a small games studio I co-founded. I worked on games like [KIDS][] and [Plug & Play][plug-and-play] and toys like [Coin][] or [Keys][]. Most of the game projects I have been involved in are made in very small teams. I have also helped others turn their vision into a finished game, like [My Exercise][my-exercise] and [TET][]. Next to some exploratory projects, I also do client work, often for projects that use digital elements in a physical space. In these projects, I do things like embedded engineering for robotics, interactive installation development (often web-based), sound editing, and art direction. Since I'm not an expert in any field, I'm more interested in consistency than virtuosity.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a [MacBook Pro 2021 M1 Max][macbook-pro] and if I'm at my studio I'm attaching a recently purchased [LG UltraWide 40WP95CP-W][40wp95c-w] to it. I was hesitant to buy such a wide and curved screen and I found it quite ridiculous when I first saw it. But after using it for a while now, I really like to have enough space when working with software with many tabs, like Unity. For input, I use an old [A1243 Apple Keyboard][keyboard] and a [Magic Mouse 2][magic-mouse-2] that I love and hate. I tried many mice, but nothing comes close to the scrolling behavior of the Magic Mouse. The cable placement makes me hate it every time I have to charge it. As headphones, I use my good old [AKG K550][k550] if it's not too hot (I don't like sweaty ears), or my [AirPods Pros][airpods-pro] (1st gen). As a secondary computer to run other OSes, I use a [Zotac ER51070][er51070], which I bought from MuDA when they [had to close](https://muda.co/closing/ "A post about the closing of the Museum of Digital Art in Zurich."). I start it about once every two months or so – if I really need to. For sketching, I use my good old [iPad Pro 2017][ipad-pro] (10.5") and an [Apple Pencil][pencil] (1st gen). My phone is an [iPhone 13 mini][iphone-13-mini]. On the shelves nearby there are boxes with [Raspberry Pis][raspberry-pi], [ESP32s][huzzah32], [Arduinos][arduino], [Jetsons][jetson], and [custom game controllers I built](https://github.com/anyuser/rakete-exhibition "Mario's GitHub project for his custom game controller.").

All this is happening on a nice, self-sanded, Lineseed-oiled beech table top mounted on a no-name height-adjustable frame, which I both really like. Other than a small plant, a [glass][pokal] of water, and a (probably empty) espresso cup, I try to have nothing on my table. My chair is a [Vitra ID Mesh][id-mesh], which I got at an office liquidation nearby almost for free. It's really great.

### And what software?

Difficult topic. The boring basics are [Apple Mail][mail], [Calendar][], and [Terminal][]. I really liked sketching in [Apple Notes][notes] on my iPad. But since they broke the functionality, where you could just drag and drop a sketch as a PNG to your desktop [a few versions of macOS ago](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254597604 "A discussion about Notes not supporting drag and drop." ), it's much less fun. For collaboration, I use [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Sheets][google-sheets] and whatever other people want to use. [Firefox][] is my main browser. I don't leave any tabs open when I stop using my computer. A closed tab is a good tab. Not closing a tab is like breathing in without breathing out. 

Other software I like or don't hate:

- Git GUI: [Tower][] (really good.)
- Code: [Rider][], [WebStorm][], [VSCode][visual-studio-code], [Sublime Text 3][sublime-text]
- Design: [penpot][]
- 3D: [Blender][]
- Video Editing: [DaVinci Resolve][davinci-resolve] (free)  
- Audio Editing: [Audacity][], [Logic][]
- Organized Notes: [Craft][craft.2] for live docs, [Markdown][] files for archiving
- Utilities: [MediaInfo][], [Angry IP Scanner][angry-ip-scanner]
- Screen Recording: [Screenflick][]

Software I would like to replace, but all the alternatives are also not really good enough from my point of view:

- Game Engine: [Unity][]
- Image Editing: [Photoshop][]
- File Sync: [Dropbox][]

There's also one self-made tool that is worth mentioning: When working on creative projects, I like to document the process to have a visual overview of older versions of a thing. It's usually just images or videos, but it could occasionally be a web-based prototype or some other file. With this tool, I just drop some files in a folder at the end of the day, add the date with some basic info as the filename, and rsync it to my web server. There, a [PHP][] script (yes, PHP still has the best small-scale web workflow that ever existed) generates a nice little website that makes it possible to go through the process archive. The result looks a bit similar to what we did for the [KIDS Process documentation](https://playkids.ch/process/ "The process documentation for the KIDS game.").

### What would be your dream setup?

Except that I would like to replace some of the software mentioned, I can't think of anything that would substantially improve my work setup. Maybe there's some room for improvement on my way to the studio – I could use definitely use a better bicycle that doesn't fall apart every now and then.
