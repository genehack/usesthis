### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Porpentine Charity Heartscape](http://slimedaughter.com/ "Porpentine's website.") and I make art to commemorate the armistice with hell.

### What hardware do you use?

[E-Element Z-88 81-key mechanical keyboard][z-88] because it was the cheapest tenkeyless. My typing got more precise after I switched to MECHA KEYBOARD and it has fun LED settings to keep me stimulated.

I'm most comfortable on my desktop but I have a [ThinkPad 13 laptop][thinkpad-13] now that I travel more. Desktops feel like a blanket.

I use a [Snowball mic][snowball], a [OnePlus 3T phone][3t], and a [Wacom Intuos Medium tablet][intuos]. [Amazon Mouse][3-button-usb-wired-mouse] because it's soft and cheap.

Cheap colored lights off Amazon strung along my walls.

### And what software?

Games/interactive stories: [Twine][] 1.4.2 and [Game Maker][game-maker]. But I've made stuff in [Unity][], [ShindanMaker][], [Google Forms][google-docs], desktop folders... I'm most interested in something if it's not intended as creative software.

Linear writing: [Notepad++][notepad-plusplus] and Google Docs for drafting, [Scrivener][] and [OpenOffice][] for organizing / publishing.

Media editing: [Paint.NET][], [Audacity][], all the cutey open source things.

I love chatting and collaborating through [Discord][].

### What would be your dream setup?

Whatever is nice. The good stuff. A big room, I guess? Running water and grass? A climate-controlled cube surrounded by 12 hours of rain and 12 hours of grass.
