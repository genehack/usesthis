### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Liz](https://www.fosslien.com/ "Elisabeth's website."). I'm the co-author and illustrator of the Wall Street Journal best-seller _No Hard Feelings: The Secret Power of Embracing Emotions at Work_ and the Head of Content at Humu, where I help teams and leaders develop the skills and habits they need to succeed at work. I live in San Francisco, love doodling, and have a long history of eyeballing leftovers and then choosing the absolute perfect tupperware container. You can see my [latest piece here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d15594116124000014ec5aa/t/5d1f93c75b995500015b0981/1562350535808/D1bLd2sU0AA2_sX.jpg "A photo of food in a Tupperware container.").

### What hardware do you use?

For sketching and note-taking, I use a gel ink pen and unlined Muji notebooks that I highly recommend. The Muji notebooks are light (so you can carry them anywhere) and cheap-ish (so you won't feel bad scrawling over pages). For digital illustrations, I use a Wacom tablet and stylus.

I do all my work on my [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] with my Jelly Comb ergonomic mouse. I highly recommend an ergonomic mouse if you've ever had wrist or arm pain. It made a huge difference for me.

### And what software?

I use [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator] for anything illustration related. I tried to switch to an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] and the program [Procreate][procreate-ios] recently but I found that you don't get the same precision that you do in Illustrator. I write everything in [Google Docs][google-docs]. My old coworker created this amazing thing called [Draftback][], which lets you play back your revision history in a Google Doc. It's super fun to see how much even a paragraph might change over time. I love seeing people's revision history. It's like getting a peek into how their brains work, and their writing processes.

### What would be your dream setup?

I like all my current tools. I'd love to live somewhere more rural, like in a big house in a more wooded area. I probably have the same aspirations as many creative introverts: a second-floor office with big windows where I feel safe and tucked away from the rest of the world. But still close to a Trader Joe's.
