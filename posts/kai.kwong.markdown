### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! I'm [Kai Kwong](https://www.kaikwong.co/ "Kai's website."), aka [dollgirls](https://www.instagram.com/_dollgirls/ "Kai's Instagram account."), a freelance designer and illustrator specializing in colorful, whimsical graphics of all kinds. My primary focus is branding and merchandise design for folks in food and beverage, but I occasionally branch out and take on projects in other industries including beauty, gaming, and stationery. I also moonlight as an art and apparel vendor at local craft markets under the moniker [Slumptown Supply Co.](https://kaikwong.square.site/ "Kai's screenprinting studio."), which features shirts and totes screenprinted by me in my little garage studio, lovingly dubbed "The Fungeon Annex." Right now I'm in the middle of illustrating a children's book about consent and bodily autonomy titled [_Yes Means Yes!_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/etaitai/yes-means-yes-a-picture-book-about-consent "Kai's Kickstarter project for her book about consent.") which received a successful Kickstarter campaign and is currently pending production.

### What hardware do you use?

For concept sketches and loose idea drafting, all my work goes into a little yellow dot-grid notebook I got from Amazon. I'm a creature of habit and I only trust two writing utensils for this part of the process: a [0.5mm Pentel Graph Gear 1000 pencil][graph-gear-1000] for sketching, and a [0.38mm black Muji ball-point pen][gel-ink-ballpoint] for writing notes. For store-related product photography I use a hand-me-down [Nikon D40][d40] and whatever I can find around the house as backgrounds/sets to stage my products.

My portable (digital) setup is split between a refurbished [9.7" 6th gen iPad][ipad]/[1st gen Apple Pencil][pencil] and my college laptop, a [2012 Sony Vaio SVS13A190X][vaio-s-series-13p] which is somehow still functional despite being almost 10 years old! I usually use the iPad when I'm on the go or need to further develop a sketch into raster artwork. Any finalization, layout, or vector work gets taken care of on the laptop. Lastly, if I need to print anything out I now have a [Canon PIXMA Pro-100][pixma-pro-100], which saves me a lot of trouble when I'm doing last minute preparation for a show or market. It's also what I use to translate my digital artwork into films that I use during the screenprinting process.

As for my printing setup, it's an old [Riley Hopkins 4 color 4 station press][250] donated to me by a local artist who was moving and couldn't fit two multi-station presses into his new studio. One of its arms is a little wonky and I need to find new springs for it, but even with 3 functional stations it still does a great job. I use a 120v Ryonet flash dryer to cure the ink on freshly printed shirts so they don't fall apart in the wash. The [other equipment](https://www.patreon.com/posts/46887698 "Kai's Patreon post about her screen printing setup.") that I use during the printing process (the washout booth, tabletop paper printing press, exposure unit, screen storage unit) were constructed with the help of my dad, who's a hobbyist woodworker. I also employ the help of a Sun Joe pressure washer to clean and expose my screens.

### And what software?

On the iPad I primarily use [Procreate][procreate-ios] and [Adobe Creative Cloud][creative-cloud] ([Photoshop][] & [Illustrator][]) on the laptop. Currently looking into getting the Photoshop & Illustrator apps on my iPad now that those are a thing too!

### What would be your dream setup?

I like my current setup for the most part, at least on the non-screenprinting side of things. I love being able to do most things at home and I take a lot of pride in managing to do all my work without having to use the newest top-of-the-line gear! That being said, I think there's a few cosmetic/ergonomic changes I could probably use going forward as I would like to stop doing all my work in the same room where I sleep. I'd say my dream setup for my design work would be a slightly modified version of what I already have, but condensed in a nice little office separate from my bedroom with a fancy checkered rug and a couch. Maybe even a desk chair with better lumbar support and a new battery for my laptop so I don't need to keep it plugged in all the time? Clearly I have my priorities straight!

My dream printing setup would involve actually going through with fixing my press and upgrading my ink curing station to something a little more reliable like a conveyor dryer, ideally a [Vastex D-100][d-100], which is the most compact model available and would fit in my remaining garage space. Right now I have to constantly interrupt my printing process by individually checking every shirt to make sure the flash dryer is actually hitting the right temperature, which doubles the amount of time I have to spend in the studio and is a complete and total bummer.
