### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Aaron Edwards](https://aaronmedwards.com/ "Aaron's website."), and I work on special projects at [Pop-Up Magazine](https://www.popupmagazine.com/ "A 'live' magazine."), a magazine that's experienced live and on a stage. I work with writers, radio producers, filmmakers, photographers, artists, and musicians to translate, adapt, and produce shows for audiences across the country. Before that, I was one of the founding editors of [The Outline](https://theoutline.com/ "An online publication."). I've written for The New York Times, [built a news app](https://www.buzzfeed.com/aaronedwards/child-im-grown "Aaron's BuzzFeed News post about the app he built.") at BuzzFeed News, and hosted a [podcast](https://theoutline.com/post/3834/rupauls-drag-race-world-dispatch "Aaron's podcast episode on The Outline.").

### What hardware do you use?

I use an extremely reliable 2012 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that I'm convinced I will own until I'm dead, an [iPhone 8 Plus][iphone-8-plus], a pair of [Ncredible1 wireless headphones][ncredible1], a notebook from the Dollar Tree across the street, and any fine-point black gel ink pen I can get my hands on. When I'm working from home, I use an iHome iBT72 Bluetooth speaker to play music. I hate the gym, so in true stay-at-home-dad fashion I sometimes read drafts or listen to tape on an Exerpeutic Folding Magnetic Upright Bike. Emphasis on sometimes. Not always. Sometimes.

### And what software?

The [Google Suite][g-suite] is my go-to for all the basics: emails, writing, editing, scheduling, video conferencing, etc. [Spotify][] for music, [Tidal][] for Beyonc√©. I stick to the [Reminders][reminders] app and [Slack][] commands for actionable short-term tasks, and the [Momentum][momentum.2] [Chrome][] extension for broader to-do lists. I have upwards of 30 news apps installed, but I only get news alerts from [BuzzFeed News][buzzfeed-news-ios], [The New York Times][nytimes-ios], and [The Guardian][guardian-ios].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd like to not feel encumbered by capitalism! A window and desk facing a lake would be nice, too.
