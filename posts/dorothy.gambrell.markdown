### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Dorothy Gambrell. I draw the weekly cartoon [Cat and Girl](http://catandgirl.com/ "Dorothy's web comic.") and biographical, donation-driven cartoons at [Donation Derby](http://catandgirl.com/dderby/ "Dorothy's donation-drive cartoons.") and charts and miscellany at [Very Small Array](http://catandgirl.com/dderby/ "Dorothy's chart website."). I ran two year-long mail clubs and made and mailed out a board game based on "Continental Drift" and coasters of the three [Graces](http://catandgirl.com/?page_id=71#coasters "Dorothy's Grace coasters.") (Kelly, Jones, Slick) and a video of "Kiss Me Deadly" that changed color based on how close each location was to the whatsit. Right now I live in Deep Brooklyn and spend days at Bloomberg Businessweek making charts and drawing pictures.

But that's not, like, who I am.

### What hardware do you use?

I use terrible cheap pencils that will not be sharpened (not worth it, don't buy them, definitely don't buy a whole lot of them at once so you're stuck using them) and a white Pentel eraser on store brand 28lb laser paper. I draw with [Uniball Deluxe Micros][deluxe-micro] 0.5mm (nearing our Crystal anniversary), a rotating cast of pens with a slightly thicker line (current: [Uniball Vision Elite 0.8mm][vision-elite]), an HP scanner (nearing our Tin anniversary) and a five year old [iMac][] (Wood! Oh, I can't wait to see what that iMac gets me). The best pens I ever had were in high school because, you know, I wasn't making a living from those pens. Now I'm used to the cheap-y stuff I draw with.

### And what software?

Cartoons get scanned into the HP scanner as bitmap and cleaned up and colored in [Photoshop][]. There are two small scratches in the scanner glass that I manually remove from every single thing that I do. At this point they are my family. They understand me. That's important.

Maps and charts are usually made in a combination of [Illustrator][] and [InDesign][]. And [Excel][] of course! Excel. I've had cassette tapes made at [wemaketapes.com](http://wemaketapes.com/ "A company in Nashville that makes custom CDs, DVDs and tapes.") and ordered licorice for licorice eyebrows at [nuts.com](http://nuts.com/ "An online nut store.") and make tee shirts with [Kurt Brunetto](http://www.brunettotshirts.com/ "A screen printing business in Connecticut."). I bought a paper cutter online. I read every [Uline](https://www.uline.com/ "A shipping supply company.") catalog. [Mrs. Uline is the highlight](https://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_President.aspx "Information about the president of Uline."). Always the highlight.

### What would be your dream setup?

Have you had that dream where you remember your apartment has had another room all along?
