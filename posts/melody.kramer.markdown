### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Mel Kramer and I'm on the digital and social strategy team at [NPR](http://www.npr.org/ "The National Public Radio site."). Before this, I worked as a writer and web producer at [Fresh Air](http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/ "A radio show about the arts.") with Terry Gross, directed, edited, and wrote for NPR's [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/ "A radio quiz show."), wrote for National Geographic Magazine, and was a Kroc Fellow at NPR. I also tweet a lot [@mkramer](https://twitter.com/mkramer/ "Melody's Twitter account.").

### What hardware do you use?

I work primarily on a [MacBook Air][macbook-air] for work. I don't use an external keyboard or mouse because I'm usually on the go. I have a phone but it's old and I primarily use it to call my parents and do crossword puzzles on the train. 

### And what software?

I probably use less software than people think, because I like doing things by hand. I do use Google Forms quite a bit - and [Adium][] to stay in touch with people using different platforms. But I'm on the native [Twitter app][twitter-ios] most of the time and don't use an RSS reader or a reader to read-stuff-later.

I use basically three apps on my phone: Twitter, [Instagram][instagram-ios], and the [NYTimes Crossword Puzzle app][nytimes-crosswords-ios]. I get a lot of emails and have some boilerplate shortcut statements that I crafted in the native [Apple Mail][mail] program, so I don't have to retype entire paragraphs. 

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm a big fan of automation when possible, so my dream setup would involve apps or software platforms that would allow me to be on as many social media platforms as possible, while spending the least amount of time doing so. When I'm not at work, I try to limit my screen time. So my actual dream setup is a book (not digital), a good cup of tea, and my dog Sadie sitting near on my lap.
