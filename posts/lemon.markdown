### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Lemon](https://ahoylemon.xyz/ "Lemon's website.") and I make websites. 

Which ones? Well, I've made a lot of dumb websites and silly games like [damn.dog](https://damn.dog/ "A web game where you try to guess the title of the supplied WikiHow image."), [idiots.win](https://idiots.win/ "A web game where you pick the top autocompleted Google search result.") and [Pretend World](https://ahoylemon.github.io/pretend.world/ "A web game where you pick the celebrity an impersonator is trying to be."), but I've only recently tried to experiment with multiplayer games, and so I started a platform for those called [kinda.fun](https://kinda.fun/ "A collection of multiplayer web games."). 

In addition to all of those, I also host a show called [The F Plus](https://thefpl.us/ "A podcast by Lemon and friends."), and that's been going on since 2009. But it's still fun, so we keep doing it.

Before the pandemic hit I was doing some international speaking at tech conferences. Now that those have all gone virtual, I still do that, but it's not nearly as fun.

### What hardware do you use?

I tend to do my work on Windows machines. My main computer is an Intel i7 tower with 3 monitors. 2 horizonal 24" ViewSonics, and one really old square LG monitor. Attached to that is this [BEJOY mechanical keyboard][gm212], which I wouldn't recommend. It feels good, but it advertises itself as "Quiet", and it is *not*. Anyway, I also use this [Anker Ergonomic Mouse][2.4g-wireless-vertical-ergonomic-mouse], and there's a [Blue Yeti][yeti] on a boom arm and a [Logitech webcam][c920].

I use my laptop pretty infrequently, but it's an Asus Zenbook. It runs pretty well, but I spilled soda on it once during a talk in Sydney, so I have to carry a keyboard with me to be able to type on it. 

I've got a couple of [Nvidia Shields][shield] in my house, which are plugged into the network for video games & tv watchin'. My phone is a [Google Pixel 3a][pixel-3a].

### And what software?

Okay, rather than dump a list of software, I'm gonna try to split this up based on what what I do on a computer...

#### When I'm making a website for myself...

I'll be doing all the code in [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code], and doing all my HTML/JS/CSS preprocessing thru [Prepros][] (because I don't like the command line) and look at the results in [Vivaldi][]. I'll check in stuff regularly using [GitHub Desktop][github-desktop] (because I don't like the command line), and if I need to make an image, I'll use [Affinity Photo][affinity-photo].

#### When I'm making a website for money...

I'm still writing code in Visual Studio Code, but might be using [Gulp][] instead of Prepros, observing the results in [Firefox Developer Edition][firefox-developer-edition] and [Chrome Dev][chrome-devtools]. If it's [PHP][] based, then I've got [XAMPP][] running. I'm probably working with a designer so I've got [Adobe XD][xd] or [Photoshop][] open for that. [Teams][] for text communications with the people involved and [Mailspring][] when I need to send an email.

#### When I'm podcasting...

Audio conversations are had in a [Discord][] server with each participant recording their own audio locally. There will be a *lot* of documents passed around, and that's all done with [Google Docs][google-docs]. When I edit, I edit things together with [Audacity][]. I've tried other stuff, but Audacity is always the fastest for me. When a file is exported, it gets one last pass thru [Mp3tag][] before being FTP'd up to the site with [Filezilla][] and then processed by the webserver. In the rare event that I'm doing something with video, recording would be [OBS][obs-studio] and editing is [Filmora][].

#### Whenever...

I bullied most of my friends into using [Telegram][], so that handles most of my personal texting. For music I use [YouTube Music][youtube-music], which is *clearly* worse than [Spotify][], but you get ad-free YouTube with it, so eh. [Pocket Casts][pocket-casts] for podcast listening. The Shields are both running [Kodi][], which handles all my media watching, and then video games are either [Steam][] or Epic (depending).

### What would be your dream setup?

Honestly, the main thing I'd like in an office right now is to be in it less often.
