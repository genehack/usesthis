### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Pier, and I usually find it hard to put myself in a box, but I generally fit under the creative technologists' label. I studied Cinema and Media Engineering and Interaction Design, and since studying I've been constantly at the intersection between design and technology. In my every day life I create in code and atoms, I build things with behaviors, I dress spaces with interactivity, I solder, I make pictures, I teach and sometimes I sail as well. 

You can find some of my work at [www.pierdr.com](http://pierdr.com/ "Pierluigi's website.").

### What hardware do you use?

I have a 15-inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (Late 2013, 2.6Ghz i7, 16GB, NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M), my everyday companion that still works quite well and so I'm delaying the switch to dongle life. I use plenty of things that are wired and I kind of like them :) I go quickly through them. I have an unexciting LG 24 inch display, and I use a 1999 lime iMac keyboard (M2452) and a Phillips [SPM4900][spm4900-10] mouse with 2 buttons and a scroll wheel. The mouse is one of my best friends because it works great with a lot of software that still has that configuration as the main paradigm. I also have a [Bamboo][] pen tablet that I use when playing with graphics. Often I connect my laptop directly via Ethernet, for nostalgia and reliability. 

I do write the firmware of some physical computing devices, particularly [Arduinos][arduino] and my own embedded boards like the [Z-One][] board or the [tramontana][] board. I also have a Raspberry Pi 4 that is connected to two speakers and works as an AirPlay receiver, where I can send music while I work. 

On my desk I also keep an oscilloscope, the Siglent SDS 1000X, a non-glamorous frog designed 3D printer, the [MOD-T][], an Apple [eMate][emate-3000] and a 1986 [512kb Classic Mac][macintosh-512k]. The two latter are part of a wider collection of old computers but are particularly iconic for me and I believe many interaction designers, as they are the "first" ones (not starting a debate here...) to embrace interaction metaphors, respectively the Notebook and the Desktop, and I found them inspiring to look at.

Under my desk I have boxes with all sorts of electronics, but my favorite devices are Raspberry Pi Zeros, ESP32 based microcontrollers, and old [PS Eye][playstation-eye] cameras and Microsoft [Kinect][] v1 (rigorously model number 1414). With these, I build sketches of installations, drawing robots, home sensors and more...

In my bag, I always keep with me an Apple [AirPort Express][airport-express] that I use to create a custom network when I need to prototype interactive spaces or connected objects, and I carry with me a Canon [550D][eos-550d], with few fixed optics: Canon [50mm f1.8][ef-50mm-f1.8-ii] and SMC Pentax 24mm F2.8 are my favorites. To complete the photo setup I have a bunch of lightweight tripods, like the Ravelli [APLT4][].

My phone is an [iPhone 6s][iphone-6s] (16GB), which is my everyday phone, but my development phone is an [iPhone SE][iphone-se] (128GB) that almost always follows me as well.

Despite my fascination with the digital world I have plenty of physical notebooks, all of them from Muji, and I write on them with Muji pens as well, black ballpoint with tip size 0.38mm.

### And what software?

A good part of my work happens in code so I use a few IDEs - [Xcode][] is my favorite. I use also [Processing][], [Sublime Text][sublime-text], [Arduino IDE][arduino-ide] and [Eclipse][]. 

I can't not mention two of the creative coding frameworks that I use and I'm a proud contributor of, [openFrameworks][] and Processing (that is not just an IDE but a full environment for creative coding). 

I use the [Terminal][] embedded in [macOS][] quite a lot - for version control, mostly [git][] and for dependency management, mostly [CocoaPods][].

Another part of my work is done in [Illustrator][], [Photoshop][] and [InDesign][] - I use these to create UI, vector images, and documents to be printed. When visualizing ideas [Blender][] is my go to tool! 

When it's about creating mechanical designs for manufacturing I mostly use [Fusion 360][fusion-360], and to create electronics I use [EAGLE][]. My utility companions for electronics are [CoolTerm][], [AVRFuses][], and [graphMe][]. 

I'm a big fan of small utilities, so I use [Spectacle][], [f.lux][], and [SelfControl][].

On [iOS][] I use the usual apps but I really like the experience of the [SoundCloud app][soundcloud-ios]. I'm also quite an experimental photography geek, and almost every day I use my own [artgram][artgram-ios] and [tramontanaCV][tramontanacv-ios] apps to capture the world in unexpected ways. 

### What would be your dream setup?

After Apple release the new [Mac Pro][mac-pro], I would definitely like to have one of those with the [Pro Display XDR][pro-display-xdr]. I think I will pair that with an Apple [HomePod][] for an improved audio experience. 

I think the list of tools related to digital fabrication could be almost infinite, but I wouldn't mind a new 3D printer, and I'd go for an [Ultimaker 3][ultimaker-3]. In my wishlist also lies a ceramics 3D printer, probably the VormVrij LUTUM 4. With ceramics and electronics, I would need a couple of ovens, specifically a kiln and a reflow oven.

Of course, I would like to have everything solar-powered and hooked up to a Tesla [Powerwall][]. 

As these tools occupy quite a little bit of space, I would need a large room, and in my dreams on one side I'd have the digital fabrication lab, while on the other I would have an inspirational display of old technologies.

When talking about photography and video I would love to have two more cameras: a Blackmagic [Micro Studio Camera 4k][micro-studio-camera-4k] with Arduino Shield to create experimental custom controllers and, clearly, some fixed focal length Micro Four Thirds lenses, from wide-angle to zoom; I would also like to update my camera, and I would probably fancy a newer Canon DSLR or a Leica M-D. With these two additions, I would mod my seasoned Canon 550D to become an infrared-only camera, and it would be a great one for outdoor photography.

All of this is quite a bit of dreaming and budget, but who knows what the future holds!
