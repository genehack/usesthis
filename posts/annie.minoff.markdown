### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Annie Minoff](https://twitter.com/annieminoff "Annie's Twitter account."), and I make podcasts! Technically, I'm a producer, which can mean a lot of things in the audio world. For me, it means I spend a lot of time talking to potential podcast guests, recording interviews, and then figuring out the best way to structure that tape into a compelling narrative. That's the idea anyway.

I used to do this for a public radio show called Science Friday. I hosted and produced a podcast for them about the backstories of scientific discovery called [Undiscovered](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/undiscovered "A podcast about science."). And now I work at Gimlet Media, where I help make their show [The Journal](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal "A podcast about money and business."). It's a daily news show about money, business, and power that we make with The Wall Street Journal. So now I get to work inside a newspaper, which is fun.

### What hardware do you use?

These days, I get to use the WSJ and Gimlet audio studios, which I know technically very little about as I didn't have to set them up! But back in Undiscovered days, we used a closet Science Friday had converted into a little office studio. It worked pretty well! The "nice mic" pictured is a Neumann [TLM 102][tlm-102].

I edit audio on a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro].

Also, this is not exactly hardware, but it is the product I plug most often and with genuine enthusiasm: Softie covers. They are literally these ridiculous little chenille covers you put on your headphone earpieces to make them more comfy to wear! And I wear my [Sony headphones][mdr-7506] pretty much all day every day, so I want to be comfy.

### And what software?

I edit audio in a program called [Pro Tools][pro-tools]. In Pro Tools, a podcast episode looks like this, with the different colored bars representing stuff people said, or a sound effect, or music. A lot of my job is moving those little colored bars around.

I write scripts in [Google Docs][google-docs]. I love how collaborative it is. I use an app called [Audio Hijack][audio-hijack] to record my phone calls and record audio off the internet. And I use either [Trint][] or [Rev][] to do my audio transcription. You pop an interview into Rev, and it'll generate this robot transcript of what everyone said, which is useful and occasionally hilarious. A teammate of mine recently rev'd an interview about Pete Buttigieg. And it produced this transcript all about Pete Booty Judge.

### What would be your dream setup?

Hm. Pro Tools never crashing would be my dream setup. More immediately, I'm really interested in trying out this transcription service called [Descript][]. Supposedly, it allows you to edit audio by editing text. So if a reporter said: "The coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan is, um, a really big deal." I could just delete the um in the transcript and it would do it to the audio too. Pretty cool.
