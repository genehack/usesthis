### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Aaron Puls](https://www.aaronpuls.com/ "Aaron's website."), a creative/photographer/designer based in Melbourne, Australia. Recently I have been applying my craft in the field of architectureâ€”a major highlight of which was representing Australia at the Venice Biennale or Architecture 2020 (well, 2021 as it turned out, thanks to COVID).
 
I have had photographs exhibited in the National Portrait Gallery of Australia, and won a few awards here and there, such as the 2008 AIPP Australian Student Photographer of the Year, a nice way to round out my time at Uni.

### What hardware do you use?

Well I'm a PC guy, lots of time in architecture will do that to you. Plus I like to think I am into gaming, but in reality I never get around to it.
 
My PC is a self-built machine, geared towards performance in [Lightroom][] and [After Effects][after-effects], those sort-of intensive programs. So a high clock speed CPU and as many cores as you can get your hands on. At the time of build it was an [Intel Core i9-9900K][core-i9-9900k]. And the best video card at the time, [GeForce RTX 2080][geforce-rtx-2080] - still pretty solid.
 
I have some nice camera stuff. A Nikon SLR kit currently, but I am on the verge of upgrading, probably to a mirrorless system (maybe a Fuji, Nikon, maybe Sony... anything but a Canon). Current camera is a [D800][] which was, you know, revolutionary at the time for its dynamic range, light sensitivity and pixel count. It is still amazing, but getting on a bit now having been released in 2012, I think it was. When on shoots I typically hire a [Nikon D850][d850] for the extra grunt - one of the greatest cameras ever made. I have a couple of tilt shift lenses - specialty gear for architecture and landscape photographers. My Nikon lenses are the 24mm tilt, 45mm tilt, a 16-35mm and a 70-200. My favourite lens is my [Sigma 85mm Art][85mm-f1.4-dg-hsm]. It is insanely sharp, beautiful bokeh, perfect for portraits and tonnes of other uses. I also have the Sigma 50mm.
 
I have a [BenQ SW270C colour correct and calibrated monitor][sw270c], a sweet spot for performance and value for a professional photography monitor, which consistently and accurately displays 99% of Adobe RGB colour space.
 
Dabbling with the idea of VR work and world creation, I just got an [Oculus Quest 2 VR headset][quest-2] - a pretty amazing piece of kit for the price and, so much fun. Also fun is my [Mavic 2 Pro drone][mavic-2-pro], but I do do some actual work with it!
 
My current favourite toy/work thing is a Luxceo LED light wand. An amazingly handy and easy to use bit of kit that has so many uses, and really very cheap for what it is.
 
Phonewise, I am stuck with my [Samsung Note 10+ 5G][note-10-plus-5g] (I think it was the first phone out with 5G) for a couple more months, but eager to jump over to the [S21][galaxy-s21-ultra-5g] or whatever is the most insane phone camera out when I am out of contract.
 
The gadget that helps the most with my work, maybe like in an abstract way, is the [Fitbit][charge-4] because it is a great motivator to keep me fit and my brain sharp.

### And what software?

Adobe. Pretty much the whole [Adobe Suite][creative-suite], I mean [Photoshop][], [Illustrator][], [InDesign][], After Effects, [Premiere][], Lightroom, [Bridge][], [XD][]. I love XD - just getting into it now, but an amazing tool for designing digital experiences. I can't find any compelling reason to get out of the Adobe creative ecosystem, it is probably going to be a lifelong thing.
 
In an effort to get organized, I have used [Trello][], but now I am mainly focused on using [Motion][motion.2] as a task management and planning system.
 
For photographers my hot tip is the Topaz Labs software suite. They have a series of AI-powered applications for photography which are amazing for enhancing photography. I would almost say mind-blowing. [Gigapixel][gigapixel-ai], [DeNoise][denoise-ai] and [Sharpen][sharpen-ai] are the ones that get a good amount of use from me. Even if you start off with an amazing quality image, they will make it more amazing.

### What would be your dream setup?

Good question. More space - space to lay things out, to have all the toys and equipment set up at the ready. A higher ceiling!
 
I would absolutely love a high end cinema camera and a set of Cine lenses. Yep... that is definitely the dream.
