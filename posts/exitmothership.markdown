### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Julian Seifert](https://www.deviantart.com/exitmothership "Julian's DeviantArt account.") and I'm a German freelance illustrator and 2D artist. I'm better known as ExitMothership, though, which is somewhat of a "brand" name for me.

My domains are visual novel backgrounds and environment-heavy illustrations, and I also work on a graphic novel project where I let my imagination run wild. 

I take a lot of inspiration from Final Fantasy and [PS1][playstation]-era JRPGs which have a certain kind of magic to them that isn't in media anymore. Being able to paint exactly how I imagine it is a personal goal for me that I strive to achieve someday.

### What hardware do you use?

I work on a custom-built PC that I needed to be able to handle big graphic data and PSDs. It's a dual screen setup with a [HP Pavillion 27cw][pavilion-27cw] as the main screen and a [HP 24es][24es] for references, background music and totally not [Netflix][].

My artworks are painted on a [Wacom Bamboo Create CTH670 tablet][bamboo-create] that I've had for years now, and which is still running strong. I feel like I don't need any other tablet except for a [Cintiq][].

Apart from that I use a simple 10â‚¬ wireless mouse and the [G430 headset][g430] from Logitech, and a pretty no-name brand keyboard. They do what they have to do without the fancy stuff.

### And what software?

For business I use [Skype][] and [Discord][].

Artwise there's a lot of variety, mainly I use [Photoshop CC][photoshop] for painting and [SketchUp][] to set up scenes with difficult perspectives and structures. In case I create my own reference for light and color I use [Sculptris][], [Blender][] and [DAZ Studio][daz-studio]. [PureRef][] is highly recommended to set up a speadsheet of references. It was recommended to me by a client and I've been using it ever since.

For me it is important to know the possibilties for optimizing your work and get to the best desireable result. I had a strong stance against using 3D in my images, for example, until a befriended artist told me that, and I'm quoting him here, "The technical process shouldn't hinder the creative." That was somewhat of an eye opener for me and now I embrace every little software program that can help me with my art.

### What would be your dream setup?

Living on a pacific island and having access to a holoroom would be awesome.

More realistically, I think a Cintique could boost my abilities. And I would like to have a studio where I can be surrounded by everything that's ever inspired me, and just get lost in the process of always creating.
