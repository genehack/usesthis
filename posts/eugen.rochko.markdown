### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am Eugen Rochko, and I am the founder and developer of [Mastodon][], a decentralized, open-source social network. I am 26 years old and I live in Germany. I have studied computer science and philosophy at a local university.

### What hardware do you use?

I have a System76 [Lemur][] laptop which I carry around, and an Acer [Predator G3-605][predator-g3-605] desktop. It has an Intel [Core i7-4790][core-i7-4790] CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA [GeForce GTX 760][geforce-gtx-760] graphics card with 1.5 GB memory. My monitor is a Samsung [LC24F390FHUXEN][c24f390fhu], a curved 24". Peripheral-wise, I have a mechanical Razer [Huntsman Elite][huntsman-elite] keyboard, a Razer [Mamba Elite][mamba-elite] mouse on a Razer Goliathus Chroma mousepad, and Razer [Nommo Chroma][nommo-chroma] loudspeakers. The lights cheer me up.

Since I also dabble in music, I have some music gear connected to my desktop. I have a Superlux [E205][] condenser microphone plugged into a Focusrite [Scarlett 2i4][scarlett-2i4] USB audio interface together with my guitars.

### And what software?

Many years ago I bought a license for [Sublime Text 3][sublime-text] and have been using it ever since. I don't use any IDEs, just a text editor. I primarily develop on [Ubuntu][]. I use [Git][] all the time. When I need to touch vector graphics, I use [Inkscape][]. If I need to edit raster images, I use [GIMP][].

### What would be your dream setup?

I think I am very privileged to say that I already have my dream setup. Some of the hardware is from before Mastodon, some is quite old, but most of the fancy things came together quite recently around Christmas, and I couldn't be happier about it.
