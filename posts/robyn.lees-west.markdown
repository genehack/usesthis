### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Robyn Lees-West and I'm a [textile taxidermist](https://www.textiletaxidermy.com/ "Robyn's website."). 

I make faux taxidermy birds from retro and reclaimed fabric. I've always had a love of pattern and colour and hoarded retro fabric (curtains, table cloths etc.) I moved from the UK to Australia about 9 years ago and absolutely love the birds here - they're so colourful and noisy. The kind of birds you would only see in a zoo or pet shop in the UK.

I was regularly taken to a couple of taxidermy museums as a child and was fascinated by them - The Booth Museum, and Potters Museum of Curiosity. Hence I inherited a fascination with taxidermy.
 
My faux taxidermy birds bring all these loves together.

The first bird I made was because we had loads of polystyrene in the house that I didn't want to go to landfill, I wanted to make something beautiful to be kept from it, so I carved a bird out of it and covered it in fabric. It has all developed from there. I keep a focus on upcycling materials. 

Each bird I make is unique and has its own character. They all contain many hours of hand stitching and embroidery. Sometimes they wear hats. I make all kinds of birds, from tiny fairy wrens to a life size pelican bust, and this year I have promised to make a full life size cassowary.

### What hardware do you use?

I'm pretty old school and do most things by hand, so my hardware is mainly my needles, pins, fabric and embroidery thread. I do a little machine sewing on a [Janome MyExcel 18W sewing machine][my-excel-18w] that I bought second hand for $50 about 8 years ago.

I take all my photos on my [iPhone 11 Pro][iphone-11-pro] and edit them on [Instagram][]. I am a complete technophobe and stick to what I know. The photos for my website are edited on Instagram then I take a screenshot. I do have a cheap lightbox that has really helped to improve my photo quality.

I use my son's old Asus laptop to manage my website, and my phone for everything else.

I'm a big fan of a hand written 'to do' list and my sketch book is full of them. I love a [Bic Biro][cristal] to both write and draw with.

### And what software?

As I said I'm a technophobe and I don't really use any software. My website is through [Wix][], and I use Instagram for photo editing.

I use [Minuteman Press](https://www.minutemanpress.com.au/ "A franchised printing company.") for all my business cards, prints, greetings cards etc. They are so patient with me and take images and text I have spliced together in PowerPoint and edit them to be perfect, free of charge. They were my best discovery of 2020.

In a previous lifetime I was in project management, so I'm pretty confident with [Excel][] for my bookkeeping.

### What would be your dream setup?

I think I have my dream setup, to be honest. We moved to Eltham, Victoria (in the green wedge) 3 years ago. I have a room with all my fabric out on shelves so I can see it and my sewing machine and lightbox set up (currently commandeered as a home office by my husband).

I actually spend every day hand sewing on the sofa with my dog, with amazing views over trees with cockatoos, lorikeets, kookaburras and king parrots visiting. I can't think of a better setup than that.
