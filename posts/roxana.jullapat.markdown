### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello, my name is [Roxana Jullapat](https://www.roxanajullapat.com/ "Roxana's website."). I'm a baker and cookbook author. For the past four years, I have owned a bakery called [Friends & Family](https://www.friendsandfamilyla.com/ "Roxana's bakery in LA.") in Los Angeles, CA. My baking (and my writing) revolves around whole grains as well as seasonal, organic fruits and vegetables. My cookbook titled _Mother Grains_ is precisely a collection of recipes to make the most of the ancient grains available to beginners and pros alike. I'm also an advocate of garden-based education and volunteer often at edible gardens around town.

### What hardware do you use?

As a writer I rely on small format hardware, specifically my [MacBook Air][macbook-air] and my iPad. Cloud storage has made this possible. In the kitchen I require more powerful equipment - I use a four-deck Empire oven, two Blodget convection ovens, and a double-rack rotating Baxter oven.

### And what software?

As far as software, [Microsoft Word][word] and [Google Docs][google-docs] seem to do the work.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream set up would require a full remodel of my current bakery to include an office with a desktop Mac, a test kitchen, and a food stylist photo studio. The bakery needs a few equipment upgrades and a more ergonomic design that includes tiles to create a serene and functional space, as well as windows or even a skylight to provide natural light.
