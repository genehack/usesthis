### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Joel David Hamkins](http://jdh.hamkins.org/ "Joel's website."), and I am a mathematician and philosopher at [The City University of New York](http://math.gc.cuny.edu/ "The City University of New York's Maths department website."). I pursue research on the mathematics and philosophy of the infinite. I have done fundamental work on forcing and large cardinals in set theory. My work on [infinite time computation](http://jdh.hamkins.org/ittms/ "Joel's post on infinite time Turing machines.") lies at the center of the recent resurgence of interest in that subject, and I am one of the world experts on the theory of [infinite chess](http://jdh.hamkins.org/tag/infinite-chess/ "Joel's posts on infinite chess."). I co-founded [Cantor's Attic](http://cantorsattic.info/ "A wiki about infinity."), a wiki-style compendium of information about infinity, and I am the top-rated contributor to [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/users/1946/joel-david-hamkins "Joel's answers on MathOverflow."), a research-level Q & A site for mathematics professionals. I have ideas about [Math for Kids](http://jdh.hamkins.org/category/math-for-kids/ "Joel's posts about maths for kids."), and my recent post on [Math for seven-year-olds](http://jdh.hamkins.org/math-for-seven-year-olds-graph-coloring-chromatic-numbers-eulerian-paths/ "Joel's post about maths for seven-year-olds.") made it to the top of Hacker News and [Digg.com][digg].

### What hardware do you use?

I work in many locations - home, office, libraries, but in truth, mainly in cafes --- and so it is convenient to use a [Sony Vaio VPC Z2][vaio-vpc-z2] ultrathin laptop for all my computer work, augmented with a docking station and a second monitor at my office. I print, scan and copy at home with a [Brother DCP 7060D][dcp-7060d] multifunction laser printer. I am constantly on my [Samsung Galaxy Note 3][galaxy-note-3] smart phone. For music, I use a [Grace digital amplifier][gdi-btar122], piping via Bluetooth from my computer or phone to the built-in speakers in my apartment.
 
I make espresso with my [Vev Vigano Kontessa stovetop espresso maker][kontessa-gold], and mix dry gin martinis using a cocktail shaker that I found in a thrift shop, but which looks exactly like [this 3D model from TurboSquid](http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/cocktail-shaker-shake-3d-max/689060 "A 3D model of a cocktail shaker."). I ride a Dutch-style [Kidz Tandem][kidz-tandem] bicycle, manufactured by Brown Cycles in Colorado, and use a [Go Pro Hero 3][hd-hero3-white] camera for automated pictures and video while riding. Almost all of the two dozen or so clocks in my home are antiques, many of them from my wife's grandfather's clock repair shop which he ran ages ago on Canal Street.
 
At the chalkboard, I use only Hagoromo faru ta'chi ("[Full-Touch][]") chalk, for which it has been claimed that [it is impossible to make a mathematical mistake when writing with this chalk](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/26267/where-to-buy-premium-white-chalk-in-the-u-s-like-they-have-at-rims/26274#26274 "A MathOverflow post about Full-Touch chalk.").

### And what software?

For all of my mathematical writing I use [LaTeX][], and specifically the [miktex][] package, using the [WinEdt editor][winedt] and the [Sumatra PDF v1.9][sumatra-pdf] viewer. My blog runs on [WordPress][], and is coupled with [my Google+ account](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JoelDavidHamkins1 "Joel's Google+ account."), and Cantor's Attic runs on [MediaWiki][]. My phone runs on [Android][], and I stay organized with the [Pocket Informant][pocket-informant-android] app. I play chess online using [Dasher][] on the [Internet Chess Club][internet-chess-club].

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream set-up would be a completely transparent, weightless technology that turned my mathematical thoughts and ideas into elegant, flawlessly written, mathematically correct arguments that would inform and enlighten humanity for millennia, while also serving up cups of espresso on demand. I suppose [The Magic Pudding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Pudding "The Wikipedia entry for The Magic Pudding."), if there were advanced mathematics amongst his other attractive wits, would be something of an approximation.
