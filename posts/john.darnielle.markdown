### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm John Darnielle. When I'm not delaying interview questions by three years or more, I'm the singer from [the Mountain Goats](http://www.mountain-goats.com/ "The band's website."). I also write novels. 

### What hardware do you use?

I record into my laptop, a [MacBook Air][macbook-air]. I just use the built-in mic. I listen using a DAC, the [HRT microStreamer][microstreamer], which I consider a key part of my setup.

### And what software?

[GarageBand][].

### What would be your dream setup?

If I had ridiculous disposable income, I'd have a studio in the backyard equipped with a 2-inch reel, probably an old Studer, plenty of tape, an [RE20][] to sing into and some Mojave Sound mics to point at the guitar, and an engineer on call, because I do not know how to run that stuff myself. But I'm never going to have that, so GarageBand & good playback DAC it is!
