### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I'm [Cher Vincent](http://chervincent.com/ "Cher's website."). I'm an independent audio producer and the co-founder of [Postloudness](http://www.postloudness.com/ "A podcast collective for shows hosted by people of color, women, and queer-identified hosts."), a podcast collective for independent audio shows hosted by people of color, women, and/or queer identified folks. I also hosted the indie podcast [Open Ended](http://www.openended.fm/ "Cher and James' podcast."), with James T. Green, where two best friends blur the lines between fact and fiction, and host [Gossip Girls](https://gossipgirls.simplecast.fm/ "Cher and Subi's podcast."), with Subi Shuh, where we discuss the CW show, Gossip Girl, from the perspective of two women of color. 

### What hardware do you use?

I record with a [Tascam 4x4][us-4x4] and a Scarlett for my hosted shows in a studio space setting. In the field, I use a [Zoom H5][h5] and a [Shure MV88][mv88] to capture everything from ambi in interesting places, subjects from ongoing projects, and conversations with people I meet in the world. In a pinch, I use my [iPhone 6s][iphone-6s] for capturing audio, and I edit using a [11" MacBook Air][macbook-air]. It's from 2011, and I put it through the ringer, but my buddy is my ride or die. 

### And what software?

I capture in-studio audio using [GarageBand][]. I edit using [Hindenburg][], [Reaper][], and [Pro Tools][pro-tools]. I typically use Hindenburg for two-way interview audio. I use Reaper when I want to use a higher grade of mixing, and Pro Tools when I need to upgrade the condition of my audio, and create filters and soundscapes.

I have also used [Sony Vegas][vegas-pro] for video/audio work, and would love to include more multimedia components to my work. 

### What would be your dream setup?

My current setup is nearly ideal. I work primarily at a co-working space that has two recording studios for flexibility with my needs. It's only once I leave the space, particularly at home, I wish I had a better setup, including a stronger MacBook, ideally a 15.4-inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] 2.2GHz Quad-core Intel i7 with Retina Display or an [iMac][] 21.5-inch iMac 2.8GHz Quad-core Intel Core i5. I would also LOVE a microphone setup, ideally a [Shure SM58][sm58].
