### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Marri Knadle](https://twitter.com/marri "Marri's Twitter account."). I'm currently the Narrative Lead (working on both narrative design and writing) at [Sonderlust Studios](https://sonderluststudios.com/ "A game studio."), where we're working hard to release our first game. It's a [redacted] about [redacted] set in [redacted]. Please look forward to it.

In the past, I've been a writer at Ubisoft on the Far Cry franchise, a medical eLearning training and gamification designer, a copy editor, and a student of the history of medicine. I also write fiction, mostly for fun right now.

### What hardware do you use?

A PC I built for myself. [AMD Ryzen 5 3.6 GHz 3600 6-core processor][ryzen-5-3600], [MSI MAG B500M Micro ATX AM4 motherboard][mag-b550m-mortar], G. Skill Trident Z 32 GB ram, [MSI GeForce RTX 2060 6 GB Ventus XS video card][geforce-rtx-2060], and a 1 TB solid state drive and a 1 TB internal hard drive, both Western Digital. This is all packed into a white [NZXT H510 ATX mid tower case][h510].

My monitor is a white [29" widescreen LG 29WK600-W][29wk600-w].

I get headaches with over-ear headphones, so I use [1MORE Triple Driver in-ear headphones][triple-driver], which I'm really happy with both in terms of build and sound.

My keyboard is a [Logitech ergonomic K860][ergo-k860], and my mouse is a [Logitech MX Vertical mouse][mx-vertical]. Both were odd to adjust to at first, but I'm glad I did.

I sit at a 52 x 22" dark blue IkEA ALEX desk (the color seems sadly discontinued) next to a matching ALEX 5-drawer unit. I'm on an armless beige [HATTEFJÃ„LL chair][hattefjall], the side of which is slowly being destroyed by my cat, [Frobisher](https://twitter.com/Marri/status/1555777916184760321 "Marri's tweet, showing a photo of her cat."), who likes to reach up and sharpen his claws on it. It's holding up remarkably well despite this treatment.

I have a [Huion Kamvas Pro 16 drawing tablet][kamvas-pro-16] for brainstorming, diagramming, and drawing. Though admittedly it's collecting dust right now, since my desk is a bit too small to use it well and I have to climb under my desk to plug it in. It ends up being easier to just grab a piece of paper or use a brainstorm diagram software. I still hold out hope I'll build up my old drawing habit though.

I have a [OneAdaptr STACK 6 detachable/interchangeable surge protector power strip][stack-6], and white twist ties for cable management.

I also have 7-year old [13.3" Asus Zenbook UX305][zenbook-ux305] that I use just for personal writing, usually on the couch. In the Before Times, I would take it to cafes.

Other assorted pieces of "hardware" that help my work day and creative process go smoothly include: a [black Zebra Sarasa Clip 05 pen][sarasa-clip-gel-retractable], Brunnen 74 x 52 mm graph index cards, Midliner highlighters of various colors, assorted washi tape, a Panda 3.3 L electric hot water boiler and warmer, a blue Liberfeel USB-plug mug heater coaster, natural cork massage balls, a MUJI aroma stone and sweet orange essential oil, and Tiger Balm.

### And what software?

For work communication and basic functions: [Firefox][], [Slack][], [Notion][], [Google Sheets][google-sheets], [Miro][], and [Unity][]. Our digital workplace is held in [Gather][], which I've really been enjoying.

For my own writing projects: [Scrivener 3][scrivener], [Microsoft Word][word], [Microsoft OneNote][onenote] (which I really love, especially for organizing inspiration and worldbuilding), [Aeon Timeline 3][aeon-timeline], [Wonderdraft][], [Pocket][], [Dropbox][], and [Excel][].

For productivity with both: [Spotify][], [Tab Session Manager][tab-session-manager], and [LeechBlock][]. I also use [f.lux][] to try and reduce eyestrain.

### What would be your dream setup?

Honestly, pretty close to what I have now. Having made do with less, I'm very grateful for what I have.  

If we're dreaming, I'd like a bigger desk that can convert into a standing desk, and a bigger monitor or maybe a dual monitor setup.

I'd love to have more space for bookshelves so I can keep building my reference libraries. I'd also like a printer, since reading and editing from the page is more comfortable than a screen for me, but I don't have room for one right now.

Oh, I'd also like a microwave, and space for it. It takes a while to heat my food on the stovetop, and I could use that reclaimed time to go for walks after eating lunch on workdays.

Most importantly, I'd like to magically transport my whole setup into a room of its own instead of in my small living room, and then place my whole living space somewhere peaceful in the woods. Quietude and a view of nature would be wonderful. I fantasize a lot about Ursula K. LeGuin's office and having a space like it.

A bird feeder in view would make it ideal. For peace, at least, if not productivity.
