### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Eva Decker, a [design engineer](https://eva.town/ "Eva's website.") and generalist web maker. I've been building things to live on the internet since I was a teenager. I currently lead design engineering at [Scribe][], and previously I've worked as a product designer at [Cityblock][], [Dropbox][], and [Swiftype][]. I enjoy bridging the gaps between design and front-end engineering and I've spent a fair amount of time building [design systems](https://eva.town/posts/commonplace "Eva's post about building a design system for Cityblock.") in and out of healthcare. I care deeply about building [accessible](https://a11y-webring.club/ "A webring for people working on digital accessibility.") technology that respects peoples' attention and energy, and I love to spend time polishing the little details and exploring [alternative ways to design](https://eva.town/posts/design-outside-the-computer "Eva's post about design inspiration from things outside a computer.") and build. I get a lot of [inspiration from video games](https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en "Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel, with videos on creating games.").

When I'm not looking at screens, I enjoy hiking, biking, playing piano, and attending Brooklyn queer events.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a [2020 M1 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. I bought my first Mac in high school with money from a summer job and I've never looked back. [macOS][] is a phenomenal operating system and I couldn't fathom ever going back to Windows.

I also have an iPhone... [12][iphone-12]? I think? I stopped being able to keep count after the [iPhone 4][iphone-4]. It's the one with the notch on the top, but before the dynamic island. I will use this phone until I inevitably crack its screen, and maybe even beyond then. I don't think people should buy a new phone every year. It's wasteful and expensive.

Last year I bought myself an [Apple Studio Display][studio-display.2], which cost a pretty penny, but—considering how much time I spend staring at it—was worth it. Display is topped with the [BenQ ScreenBar monitor light][screenbar] for good desktop lighting on my [UPLIFT standing desk][uplift].

I tried switching to a [cute mechanical keyboard][halo65] last year, but the higher key travel rendered me completely unable to type a full sentence without making typos, so I regretfully and with some amount of shame returned to using my [Magic Keyboard][magic-keyboard] and [Magic Trackpad][magic-trackpad]. I do miss using the adorable keycaps I bought, so maybe I'll give it another go some day.

I have a used [Steelcase Gesture ergonomic chair][gesture] from Craigslist and fitted it with hardwood-friendly and super-silent rollerblade chair wheels.

For sketching I use a Midori MD dot grid notebook. The paper texture and quality is just perfect. Mine lives in a cute slip cover that I've plastered with stickers.

### And what software?

For design, I use [Figma][] and, less frequently, [Photoshop][] (although I'm looking to abandon Adobe). I find and organize inspiration on [Are.na][are.na].

For code, I use [VS Code][visual-studio-code] (but keeping an eye on [Zed][]), [Warp][] ([Rust][]-based terminal), [Polypane][] (the browser for web developers!), and, of course, [GitHub][]. I deploy most of my personal sites with [Vercel][], and my favorite frameworks right now are [Astro][astro.2] and [SvelteKit][].

Other notable tools include [Fathom][] for privacy-friendly analytics, [Buttondown][] for newsletters, [Discord][] for chatting with various web communities, [ImprovMX][] for email forwarding, and [Day One][day-one] for journaling. Phew!

### What would be your dream setup?

Email does not exist. I am surrounded by trees and no screens. I “design” (plant) “UI/UX” (fruits and vegetables) for “users” (me and my lovers). We have phenomenal ROI.
