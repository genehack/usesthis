### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Leah Finnegan](https://twitter.com/leahfinnegan "Leah's Twitter account."). I am the features editor at [The Outline](https://theoutline.com/ "An online publication.") and I write a semi-regular newsletter called [Leah Letter](http://theoutline.us14.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=7d9a179d9349586da8d1fd80f&id=47c259ca85 "Leah's newsletter.") about how the media is bad.

### What hardware do you use?

I use an 11-in [MacBook Air][macbook-air], a 23-in [Dell monitor][s2318nx], an [Apple Magic Keyboard][magic-keyboard], the cheapest [Logitech wireless mouse][m325] Staples had in stock which is very small and I love it, a mouse pad with wrist support, an [iPhone 6s][iphone-6s] which I can't wait to get rid of because the battery life is one minute, and a 6-ft iPhone charging cord.

I have a [rolling desk][go-cart] from CB2 and some matching filing cabinets that I store sweaters in. I don't have any actual files. I have a lot of chairs. My desk chair is a vintage green velvet cantilever chair that I got at a store called Coming Soon. It has improved my working life considerably.

For six years I lived in a shoebox studio and basically did all my work on my laptop in bed. Now I live in a shoebox one-bedroom and having space for a desk and a chair and all the things you can put on a desk has been a revelation. I also have a [one-cup Keurig][k10] which is very important to me. 

### And what software?

[Gmail][], [Feedly][], [TextEdit][], [Google Docs][google-docs], [Slack][], [Twitter][], [Kindle for iPhone][kindle-ios], [Brainium Solitaire for iPhone][solitaire-ios], and [iTunes][] because I still buy all my music like an elderly person. 

### What would be your dream setup?

My apartment, but in a silent place, with a constantly replenishing supply of Diet Coke.
