### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! I'm [Dr. Psyche Williams-Forson](https://psychewilliamsforson.com/ "Dr. Psyche's website."), aka Dr. Psyche, aka Dr. PWF, and what I do is profess to know stuff about food, gender, race, class, and culture, especially material culture like food and foodways of people throughout the African Diaspora. I’m a writer and a thinker, and I also get paid to chair a department at the University of Maryland College Park. That’s what I do. Who I am is a daughter, a friend, and a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. I’m really also a PhDMom, aka a part-time photographer (or is this my real job?) for my young adult daughter. Because if she is with me, I’m taking her picture - on portrait and landscape - thanks iPhone.

### What hardware do you use?

[MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. And, I’ve been corralled into an iPhone by said daughter because “Mom, now we can [FaceTime][]” and, of course, take better pictures. Said iPhone is also my go-to for listening to books on tape (thank you, local library [Libby app][libby-ios]) and for meetings, keeping my calendar, checking email, and conducting all kinds of impromptu interviews. Because you never know when a family member or friend will launch into a new story that is usable. When I super have my act together, I use a [Zoom H1N Handy Recorder][h1n], with a one-touch button and a [VidPro Lavalier condenser microphone][xm-l], because the voice recorder app is not reliable. After doing yet another podcast in what looks like a dark tunnel, I was convinced of the need to buy a Weilisi 10” ring light. They wanted me to buy three but do I need that much light?

I backup everything relentlessly with a [2 TB WD Elements external hard drive][wd-elements-desktop] and I thank [Time Machine][time-machine] for the constant reminders of my dereliction. A wonky large LG flatscreen TV gives me access to lots of pop culture fodder, and a smaller, wonkier one does the same in my home office. I live on the edge with both Verizon cable (software?) and an [Amazon Fire TV Stick][fire-tv-stick], with no usable remote - enter said iPhone and the [Fire TV app][fire-tv-ios]. My ultimate, can’t live without hardware, are my many bookshelves - maybe 6 or so that hold my books, all of which I have held in my hands, even if I have not read them in all in full.

### And what software?

I’m a Google user, although I hate [Gmail][]. Bring back [Outlook][]. [Google Docs][google-docs] and Google tabs compete for space on multiple email accounts. When I need to scan something in a pinch, [Tiny Scan][tiny-scan-ios] comes in clutch. Then I use the usual - [Adobe Acrobat][acrobat] and Microsoft suite - mostly [Word][] and [PowerPoint][]. I hate [Excel][] but will use it when the business people need me to read a file or three. To send large video and visual files I use [Hightail][] or Google, both get the job done well. Hightail is also great for sending secure docs. These days, grad students will text me so [iMessage][] is key, but also [Facebook Messenger][facebook-messenger]. Zoom has replaced [Skype][] in my world of things and [Siri][] comes in when you need the handsfree option. When I’m writing, [Grammarly][] is amazing, and annoying, at the same time. And though I’m still trying to find the best way to manage citations, [Zotero][] is a frontrunner for my next project to organize my data.

To keep my sanity, I use game apps - [Spades Plus][spades-plus-ios] rules! But also [Royal Match][royal-match-ios], [Dropdom][dropdom-ios], [Woody Battle 2][woody-battle-2-ios], and [Uno][uno-ios]. [Gin Rummy][gin-rummy-ios], [Match Triple 3D][match-triple-3d-ios] - I probably should be embarrassed at the number of games I play but I’m not. [Words with Friends 1][words-with-friends-ios] just gave me two words that scored 549 points and 446 points and now I’m on a mission, which really is just a matter of some well-placed high point value tiles. I can do this!!!! [Match Masters][match-masters-ios] and [Toy Blast][toy-blast-ios] work when I’m flying and nothing else will talk to Southwest WiFi. I have to play at least a game of Spades (best out of three), before I can start working. It’s a ritual that started in graduate school along with early morning meditation via [YouTube][] and [iTunes][] to ground myself and prepare for the craziness of the day. And when I want to work deeply, I need [Netflix][] for background noise, though Prime and BritBox do a great job of providing necessary visual sustenance.

### What would be your dream setup?

A corner condo unit overlooking the Potomac. I want to be a minimalist but my life as a material culturalist screams maximalist. Like, why am I thinking about getting a workstation desk bike? Because I just don’t have enough unused exercise stuff in my house (I really don’t) but THIS, THIS I will use, especially in my dream space, which will have lots of room for me to fill with “stuff.”
