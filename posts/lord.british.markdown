### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Richard Garriott de Cayeux](https://richardgarriott.com/ "Richard's website."). I am a creator & explorer! My creations include the Ultima series of computer games, from which comes the now common use of the term "Avatar" and the field of games known as MMO's (Massively Multiplayer Online) games. I am also a flown private astronaut and the first second generation astronaut.

### What hardware do you use?

I am a slave to my online calendar. If an activity - from phone calls, to travel, to dining with family - is in my calendar, I will be there... if not, don't expect me. To that end, my mobile device and PC are keys to my lifestyle. I always carry the latest iPhone model, and my PC is a supped up ORIGIN-brand machine in my offices and travel laptop. Beyond these, I am a devout believer in augmenting your reality with other techno bits - I wear a [Motiv][] ring which monitors my activity levels, heart rate and sleep as well. Being well informed at least provides the ability to make better choices.

Oh, I would be remiss not to point out that I spend half my work life... as a robot. For nearly a decade, I have lived most work days as a robot, via a telepresence robot being driven from NYC but roaming our offices in Austin, Texas. I have owned most of the models that have been developed. But the current best which we use is called [Beam][beam-pro].

### And what software?

Beyond being a slave to [Outlook][] for my crammed schedule and too many emails to answer... for computer game development, we use [JIRA][] for planning and tracking. We recently moved to [Mattermost][] as an internal chat channel tool. But, these days I spend even more time in [PowerPoint][], as I am called these days to give presentations on games, space, exploration, automatons and oddities which I collect.

### What would be your dream setup?

In my dream future, my desk sits in a VR cave, so that I have a full 360 view in 3D at high resolution. Then I can teleport to any place, and "be there" while using that virtual world as my work surface. Make it on a full motion platform, and it would be my gaming platform as well!
