### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Bill Day](https://live.mrbillstunes.com/ "Bill's website."). I produce music under the name Mr. Bill & Electrocado (w/ Ryanosaurus). I create educational content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBillsTunes "Bill's YouTube account.") & mrbillstunes.com that revolves around electronic music production, and travel the world playing electronic music to people in clubs, live venues & festivals as well as doing masterclasses at schools.

I run 2 record labels, [Billegal Beats](https://billegalbeats.com/ "Bill's glitch label.") & [Billegal Sounds](https://splice.com/sounds/billegal-sounds "Bill's sample packs label."), which are branches of my online community & release electronic music & sample packs respectively.

I host the [Mr. Bill Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-mr-bill-podcast/id1480159954 "Bill's podcast."), where I chat to guests every Monday. I stream on [twitch.tv/mrbillstunes](https://www.twitch.tv/mrbillstunes "Bill's Twitch account.") very intermittently.

### What hardware do you use?

I use two different computers - when I'm in the studio I use a [custom rack-built PC](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/v8VQhq "Bill's Windows computer on PCPartPicker.") & when I'm travelling I use an MSI GS63VR 15" Stealth, both running [Windows 10][windows-10].

I use a Razer [DeathAdder mouse][deathadder-elite] & a Goliathus mousepad whilst travelling & whatever MSI mouse my laptop came with & a SteelSeries mousepad in the studio. My studio is full of GIK Acoustics panels. I use a [DJM-900NXS][] or [2][djm-900nxs2] live & just USB straight into that bad boy, then set 4 audio-tracks in live to send straight to that. I use 2 x [CDJ-2000's][cdj-2000] & a [DJM-750][] in my studio for practice (mainly cos they were cheaper). I have an Argosy [Halo desk][halo] in my studio & some 43 inch Acer monitor (if that counts?).

I use many different soundcards, the main 3 being an RME [Fireface 802][fireface-802] & Yamaha [AG03][] (for streaming to [Twitch][]) in the studio & a NI [KOMPLETE AUDIO 6][komplete-audio-6] whilst travelling. I use Barefoot MM27 Gen 1's in the studio & Audeze [LCD-X's][lcd-x] whilst travelling. When I'm on a plane I use Shure [SE215's][se215].

Guitar-wise I use a Schecter [Demon-7][] & an [Axe-FX II][axe-fx-ii], as well as some Guild acoustic guitar. If I'm running DSP in my studio I'll use a [miniDSP 2x4][minidsp-2x4] + a Metric Halo ULN-2 (for the D/A conversion) - however, at the time of writing this I'm not. I also use a [modular Eurorack system](https://www.modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/499303 "Bill's rack system.") in the studio. I have an Absinthe Green Pearl Masters in my studio which I use sometimes for recording breaks (usually with a single overhead [SM57][]). I mostly use SM57's for everything)

### What would be your dream setup?

Dream setup would likely just be a fairly flat room with really nice speakers that's comfortable to sit & work at and doesn't feel too sterile (like some studios can) with a really fast computer that is nicely file managed and has lots of nice software on it. I actually don't really like the classic sterile studio vibe - I prefer working in bedrooms in houses for some reason, so it'd have to be some hybrid between a bedroom and studio vibe.
