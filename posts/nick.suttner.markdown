### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Nick Suttner](https://nicksuttner.com/ "Nick's website.")! I did biz dev for indie games at PlayStation for a long time, Oculus for a short time, and these days I'm a freelance writer, designer, and consultant. I also help run Games at Panic, publishers of [Untitled Goose Game][untitled-goose-game] and the cranky upcoming portable system, [Playdate][]. I worked on games like [Celeste][] and [Guacamelee! 2][guacamelee-2], and I have a bunch of writing work in several upcoming games I can't talk about just yet.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a 13" [MacBook Air][macbook-air] from 4-5 years ago, and a 27" [iMac][] that's about the same age  and holding up beautifully! And a Windows PC at work to run early game builds when needed, but: ew. Sorry. I also just bought some Sony [MDR-7506][] headphones for my desk, which seem great so far.

### And what software?

Lots of [Slack][]. Way too much Slack! And mostly [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Sheets][google-sheets] for writing/planning. I'd love to use something more elegant, but I find the functionality and ubiquity hard to beat. I used [Scrivener][] several years ago when I wrote [my first book](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/shadow-of-the-colossus-by-nick-suttner "Nick's book about Shadow of the Colossus."), which I loved and would use again. I edit podcasts in [GarageBand][], as I always have.

### What would be your dream setup?

As much as I value my co-working space, I would love to _also_ have a proper home office setup - a fancy chair, some nice speakers, an adjustable desk, and the hardware nearby to run anything I need without overthinking it. Definitely a priority for the next place I move into. And surrounded by posters of inspiring art from film and games that I love, natch.
