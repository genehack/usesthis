### Who are you, and what do you do?

hi! i go by [equa](https://equa.space/ "equa's website."), natalia, and soweli nata (all of which are lowercase) depending on the situation. i'm presently a student. i'm super queer and i have no idea what i'm doing most of the time.

i make art for fun, which tends to mean i don't work on anything consistently. i used to work on computer-generated visual art (my proudest of which being [imaginary landscapes](https://equa.space/imaginary-landscapes/ "equa's ASCII landscapes zine."), an ASCII art collection), but recently i've shifted my energy into learning to create music. i've also become a fan of [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/ "A human language with 120 words."), a minimalist constructed language with around 120 words. my recent work has been less visible and less frequent, but i've been enjoying the exploration just as well.

i've found a fascination in texture, whether in visual art or music. i love the way sounds and words on a page feel when they collide and overlap and become a larger whole with each other. i also love fucking things up by putting them in tools designed for the wrong job.

### What hardware do you use?

i used to use a thinkpad, and i still do, but it has numerous power supply failures on top of other issues that prevent me from doing most of my work (especially anything involving a web browser) with it. i use a slightly newer hp laptop now.

for music, i have an [m-audio keystation 49][keystation-49] as well as a smaller [akai lpd8][lpd8], which has drum pads and knobs. they're nice for bridging a very small portion of the gap between my screen and making anything that feels human. i have a few tape players i've found at thrift stores. all of them run at slightly different speeds if they work at all, and the most convenient one to use has a broken rewind button. i haven't gotten as much use out of them as i'd like, but i still love them.

i have a [2ds][] i use for emulation. every pair of headphones that doesn't have some sort of detachable or replaceable cable has broken on me within months. i very recently got my hands on a drawing tablet, and i'm looking forward to experimenting with its uses in actual drawing and as a more versatile tool for interactively making things.

i have a set of unorganized notebooks. i haven't come up with any scheme for using them that works, so i just write things in whichever makes me happy at the time.

### And what software?

my computers run [debian][]. it works most of the time!

regrettably most things i work on end up involving some sort of programming. i really like using [lisps][lisp]. i am a fan of [scheme][], and i feel most at home with [racket][]. recently i've been working on projects with [fennel][], a cute little lisp that compiles to [lua][]. i adore programming systems with few requirements; i'm comfortable knowing it's unlikely for them to break because of things outside of my control.

i edit everything using [vim][], with syntax highlighting entirely disabled barring comments.

i love [pandoc][], the near-universal document converter, and [LaTeX][]. LaTeX is a powerful but unwieldy tool; using pandoc lets me write in a format i can manage. pandoc also powers most of my website, and my text-based art is all built with LaTeX.

my favorite image editor is [audacity][]. sometimes it gets finicky with how it chooses to import its data, but i have a few scripts i run to make things easier, and after a while things really start to feel more intuitive. sometimes i use [krita][] too.

at the top of most of my music stuff is [ardour][]. i have a few odd problems with it, but it works! i use a lot of other things underneath: [pure data][pure-data] is a playful sound tool that's great for making and breaking noises, and [fluidsynth][] and [samplv1][] are wonderful general-purpose instruments.

my all-time favorite tool is [little sound dj][little-sound-dj], a sequencer for the [nintendo gameboy][game-boy]. it's been in development since 2000, and every time i update it i'm surprised to find out they've managed to squeeze even more power out of the thing! [the gameboy sounds great with other effects](https://inata.bandcamp.com/album/liftoff-landing "The Liftoff/Landing album on Band~Camp."), too. i emulate it on the 2ds most of the time and it's my favorite thing to compose with. it's limited but intuitive and fast. i wrote [a program that adjusts its tuning](https://equa.space/music/lsdj-tuner/ "equa's tool for tuning Little Sound DJ."), and it's the only way i've been able to experiment well with [microtonal composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtonal_music "The Wikipedia entry for microtonal music.") so far.

### What would be your dream setup?

computers are made of blood and i hope to never buy a new one again. i'd also like a nice 4-track recorder, or at least a tape deck with a working rewind button and a gain meter. i want to experiment with different ways to use the tools i have as interfaces for making art; building things via typing at a screen has a tendency to be deeply uninspiring, and i'd love to try stranger techniques. isomorphic musical keyboards come to mind. mostly i look forward to developing deeper relationships with the tools and instruments i have now.
