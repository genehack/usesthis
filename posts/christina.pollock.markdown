### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Christina](https://chhopsky.tv/ "Christina's website.") and I'm a game developer. I'm currently a programmer on Call of Duty, but how I got here is really weird. My work history includes esports, media, photography, consulting, and the music industry, which explains...

### What hardware do you use?

My setup is also really weird. I use a [Windows 10][windows-10] PC with an [AMD 3900X][ryzen-9-3900x], 64gb of RAM and an [RTX 3080][geforce-rtx-3080]. Three monitors, a 144hz [Asus PG278Q][rog-swift-pg278q] in the middle and two [27" Asus ProArts][proart-display-pa278qv] flanking it - one switches between vertical and horizontal, depending on what I'm doing. Input-wise, there's a SteelSeries [Apex Pro TKL][apex-pro-tkl], a [Razer Viper][viper-ultimate], an [Elgato Stream Deck][stream-deck] and an [XL][stream-deck-xl], and a [15" XP-Pen graphics tablet][artist-15.6-pro].

For a webcam I've got a [Sony ZV-E10][alpha-zv-e10] with the [16-50mm kit lens][e-pz-16-50mm-f35-56-oss], backed up by a pair of [Elgato Key Lights][key-light] and an array of [Philips Hues][hue] of various kinds, for any lighting conditions I can dream of. Unfortunately the USB webcam mode has latency and is fiddly so I back that over HDMI into a [Razer Ripsaw HD][ripsaw-hd], which is the best consumer capture card I've ever used.

Audio interface is a [Focusrite Scarlett Solo][scarlett-solo] for guitar, bass, and either a [RØDE NT1-A][nt1-a] or a [Behringer XM8500 mic][xm8500], depending on need. Secondarily there's audio and midi input from a [Roland SPD-SX SE drum pad][spd-sx-special-edition] with a pair of [KT-10 kick triggers][kt-10]. For musical MIDI input there's a [Novation Launchpad X][launchpad-x], a [Launchkey Mini][launchkey-mini], and a [Casio CT-S300][casiotone-ct-s300] for two-handed piano input. The main guitar is an [Ibanez RG752WMFX-OL seven string][rg752wmfx-prestige], bass is a [Fender Precision Highway-1][precision-highway-1], Norman B16 for steel string acoustic, as well as some six-string electrics: A Korean '96 [Ibanez SV420FM][sv420fm] and a Mexican [Fender Strat][stratocaster]. All these combine into a pair of [Mackie CR3-X monitors][cr3-x] which saves the use of a mixer, and for headphones there's [Denon AH-D5200s][ah-d5200].

I also use a [RØDE NT-USB Mini][nt-usb-mini] and a [Logitech Pro-X headset][pro-x] when I need to keep things simple, and a [Razer Seiren X][seiren-x], and wireless Pro-X for travelling.

For broadcast, there's a [Mackie ProFX8 v2][profx8-v2], three [Audio-Technica BPHS-1 headsets][bphs1], an [Akitio Node Lite Thunderbolt PCI-E dock][node-lite] with a [Magewell Quad HDMI][pro-capture-quad-hdmi] in it, all fed into a 2021 [Razer Blade Advanced 15"][blade-15-advanced]. That's an [i7-11800H][core-i7-11800h], 16gb of RAM, and an [RTX 3060][geforce-rtx-3060]. Video there's a [Canon XA20][xa20] for the main camera, and a pair of Sony CX-305s for personal aside closeups. And of course a pair of Elgato Stream Decks - one XL, one regular.

For backend service development I use a [Lenovo ThinkPad P15S Gen2][thinkpad-p15s], same spec as the Blade but with 32gb of RAM and an [RTX A4000][rtx-a4000], which is roughly 30% more powerful than the 3060.

For photography, I'm still rocking my oldest gear. [Canon 1D Mk3][eos-1d-mark-iii] and a [7D Mk1][eos-7d]. Wide selection of glass but mostly the [24-70mm F/2.8L][ef-24-70mm-f2.8l-usm], [11-40mm F/4L][ef-11-24mm-f4l-usm], [300mm F/4L][ef-300mm-f4l-is-usm] and a [Sigma 150-600mm F.5-6.3][150-600mm-f5-6.3-dg-os-hsm]. Embarrassed to say my old favorite [F/1.4 50mm][ef-50mm-f1.4-usm] does not see much use these day.

### And what software?

Software! [VSCode][visual-studio-code] with [WSL2][windows-subsystem-for-linux] and [Docker][] Desktop for all my [Python][] needs (infrastructure, scripting), and [Visual Studio 2019][visual-studio] for game engine code. For prototyping I use [Unreal][unreal-engine], and for writing I either use [Twine][] for structure/flow or [Scrivener][] for getting real work done. For audio, [Reaper][], and for video, [Davinci Resolve][davinci-resolve]. For live broadcast, a combination of [vMix][] and [OBS][obs-studio], depending on the task. Even though I absolutely resent Adobe, I'm still using [Photoshop][] and [Lightroom][] for photos.

For guitars I like [Archetype: Gojira VST][archetype-gojira] and [Darkglass][darkglass-ultra] for bass.

### What would be your dream setup?

This, but in a cabin in the woods.
