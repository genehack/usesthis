### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Matthew Parachini, otherwise known as [MP Edits](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMineMach "Matthew's YouTube channel.") on [YouTube][]. I create animated and edited [Destiny 2][destiny-2] content about weapons in the game that are either outright broken or just hilarious in their own right. I typically ask professional Destiny 2 players in the community to offer their gameplay of them using the gun so that I can include it in my video and give it my own editing twist!

Other than running my personal YouTube channel, I also run a [Discord][] server and edit for other YouTubers. Outside of YouTube I play guitar and am currently enrolled at the University of Central Florida to get my master's in aerospace engineering.

### What hardware do you use?

My hardware setup is a pretty standard PC gaming set-up; which, coincidentally, synergizes well with high-density video editing. My computer runs an Intel [Core i7-7700k CPU][core-i7-7700k] @ 4.20GHz, 64 GB of RAM, and a NVIDIA [GeForce GTX 1060][geforce-gtx-1060] 6GB graphics card. For space, my SSD is a Samsung 250GB [850 EVO][850-evo] paired with a 1TB hard drive.

Outside of the computer, I have two 27" 60Hz HP monitors with a 43" TV wall mounted above the two monitors. For the keyboard and mouse, I use a Logitech [G910 keyboard][g910] and Razer [Basilisk][] gaming mouse. I use a Blue [Yeti][] stand up mic for chatting with my buds and voice audio capture for YouTube videos, and for audio output, I use a pair of Bose [QuietComfort 35 II][quietcomfort-35-ii] Bluetooth headphones (not the best gaming headset but I just can't get over the comfort and audio quality, which is really useful for long nights of video editing!)

### And what software?

Software is pretty simple here, the Adobe Suite! I use [After Effects][after-effects] about 90% of the time, but other than AE I use [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro], [Photoshop][], [Lightroom][], and [Media Encoder][media-encoder]. After Effects is such a powerful motion graphics software that I never really feel forced to use anything else. I have a few AE plugins that help me edit: [Motion Bro][motion-bro], [Twixtor][] Pro, and [SABER][]. 

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm using it! I love the setup that I'm currently using. If I had to change anything I would probably just upgrade my computer hardware to fancier and faster hardware, but that's just impractical, haha. My hardware is fast enough for me. Realistically, I could use a Core i9 instead of a Core i7 because the i9 would render previews in AE faster, but again, I'm more than satisfied with what I have currently.
