### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Amie](https://mastodon.design/@heyamie "Amie's Mastodon account."), a designer who dabbles on code. I'm currently a product designer at [GitHub][] and have been working in the developer tools space for almost 5 years. Outside of work, I'm finishing my Master's degree on web technology.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a 13-inch M1 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] for work and a M1 [MacBook Air][macbook-air] as my personal device. I dock it to a [Dell UltraSharp U2720Q 27"][u2720q] with [Creative Pebble V3][pebble-v3] as my speakers. My webcam is the [Logitech Streamcam][streamcam] in white. I use a [Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac][mx-master-3] as my mouse and the [Apple Magic Keyboard][magic-keyboard] as my keyboard. I juggle between the [AirPods Pro][airpods-pro] and the [Sony WH-1000xm3][wh-1000xm3] as my headphones.

My desk is a custom made white standing desk and I have a [Herman Miller Mirra 2][mirra-2] chair in slate grey. I occasionally power walk on my [Walking Pad P1][p1.2] on my desk while reading emails.

I carry an [iPhone 14 Pro][iphone-13-pro] as my main phone and a [Samsung S22][galaxy-s22] as my work phone. I've also been using my [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] from 2019 a lot more to write my thesis.

I also have a [Nintendo Switch][switch.2] docked to my screen for a post-work chill session playing Zelda.

### And what software?

- [Arc][arc.2] as my browser.
- [Cron][] as my calendar.
- [Eagle][eagle.2] for inspiration.
- [Obsidian][] with the Minimal theme.
- [Texts][] to manage my messages.
- [Zotero][] for reference-managing.
- [Figma][] for design.
- [Spotify][] for the tunes.
- [VSCode][visual-studio-code] with the Night Owl theme as my IDE.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm pretty happy with my setup at the moment, but I would love to upgrade my screen to something better like the [Studio Display][studio-display.2]. The built-in webcam and speakers are a bonus, I'm not too keen on external speakers cluttering my desk.

I'm also shopping around for a wireless mechanical keyboard for that clickety clack satisfaction, as I'm writing a lot more now.
