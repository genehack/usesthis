### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hey! I'm Zack, and I like to think I'm a pretty good designer. Oh, and I host a weekly live stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/traderzed "Zack's Twitch account."), where I play video games and chat with lovely people! I originally got into design back in high school, where I was lucky enough to attend the local 'bad kid school', which, like most bad kid schools, is also the art kid school. I took digital design which really got me excited about the intersection of technology and design. From there I ended up studying web dev in college, and went on to have a very interesting career as a web developer which took me through a bunch of different industries, from advertising to product startups. 10 years later, I woke up and realized I was completely unhappy, and decided to refocus back into design. Now I work at one of the world's biggest gaming companies doing some pretty awesome design work, which is my literal dream job. 

When it comes to streaming, I really wanted to create a space where other queer people could come and hang out and feel safe and comfortable, free from judgement or harassment. I started streaming during the height of problematic YouTube personalities where I wasn't seeing genuinely good people creating genuine communities for marginalized folks. Over the last 4 years, I've built a really lovely community that I'm so grateful for.

### What hardware do you use?

My work hardware is nothing exciting, I use one of the TouchBar equipped [MacBook Pros][macbook-pro], which if you've never used before, I would really recommend staying away from. It basically gives me anxiety to rest my fingers on my keyboard which is literally the entire point of a keyboard. I would accidentally lock my laptop at least 4-5 times a day before discovering I could disable that feature - total headache. 

My streaming setup, on the other hand, is pretty rad. I have dual LG 4K IPS monitors which make me feel like some sort of spaceship commander, but they've been pretty essential for streaming where I need to run a game on one screen, while monitoring chat, social media, and stream scenes on the other. For a mic, I use the [Blue Yeti][yeti], which is a great USB mic, and for camera I use my [Sony Cyber-shot RX100 V][cyber-shot-rx100-v], which is definitely overkill for a webcam, but as a hobby photographer, I already had the camera handy. When it comes to lighting, I have a low profile Neewer LED keylight which casts some pretty powerful beams and has full temperature control. The PC itself is also pretty rad - here are the specs, but don't ask me what any of this means, I just did whatever PC Part Picker told me to do:

- CPU: [AMD Ryzen 7 2700 3.2 GHz 8-core Processor][ryzen-7-2700]
- Motherboard: [ASRock B450 Pro4 ATX AM4][b450-pro4]
- Memory: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB DDR4-3200
- Storage: [ADATA Ultimate SU650 2.5" SSD][ultimate-su650]
- Video Card: [Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2070][geforce-rtx-2070] (8 GB)
- Case: [NZXT H500 - White][h500]
- Power Supply: [EVGA SuperNOVA 550 G3][supernova-550-g3]

### And what software?

For design, it's fairly straight forward. My team at work uses [Adobe XD][xd], which... I'm generally not a fan of, but it does the job. A large part of my job also involves research, so there are some really great user research tools over at [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/ "User research and testing tools.") that I swear by. In addition, I spend most of my days in [Slack][], [G Suite][g-suite] ([Docs][google-docs], [Sheets][google-sheets] and [Slides][google-slides] mostly). I would also die if I didn't have access to [Notion][]. It helps me stay organized and plan my day - total life saver. 

For streaming, that's a little more complicated. I mostly use [OBS][obs-studio] (Open Broadcast Software), which is an incredible open source broadcasting software that allows for some really powerful customization. I also use [StreamElements][] for bot commands, [Discord][] for community engagement and [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/ "Tools for streamers.") for all those fancy stream alerts that go off when someone subscribes or follows. 

### What would be your dream setup?

At work, I'd be pretty happy if I could use [Figma][] for design and prototyping, and honestly, I wish I could replace all my organization tools with a legit assistant that could just tell me what I need to do, but I'm nowhere close to being that kind of person. 

I have a pretty solid streaming setup right now which totally does the job I need it to do with very little fussing. The only thing that would make it more of a dream would be if I didn't have to have so much clutter on my desk. If there was a way to make all the peripherals disappear, that would be an absolute dream.
