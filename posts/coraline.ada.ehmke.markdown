### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm the notorious social justice warrior [Coraline Ada Ehmke](https://twitter.com/CoralineAda "Coraline's Twitter account."). I work remotely from Chicago as a Principal Engineer for [Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/ "A personalised online clothes store."). I'm an open source advocate, international speaker, and software developer with over 20 years of experience building apps for the web. I was recognized for my work on diversity in open source with a Ruby Hero award in 2016. I'm also the creator of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ "An open source code of conduct."), the most popular open source code of conduct in the world with over 40,000 adoptions. I'm a founding panelist on the [Greater Than Code podcast](https://www.greaterthancode.com/ "A podcast about tech and people."), and in my free time I work on a secret artificial intelligence project and write and record music as [A Little Fire Scarecrow](http://alittlefirescarecrow.com/ "Coraline's music project.").

### What hardware do you use?

[2017 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], maxed out specs, side by side with a [27" Cinema Display][cinema-display]. I use a Kinesis split mechanical keyboard and a Bluetooth [Magic Trackpad][magic-trackpad].

In my music studio I also use a [Presonus FaderPort 8][faderport-8], a [LinnStrument MIDI controller][linnstrument], and an M-Audio rack mount audio interface. This lets me record my nine guitars, bass, Prophet analog synth, mountain dulcimer, and vocals and mix them to perfection. The studio is dominated by a walnut-stained [Platform music production desk][platform] from Output. It's huge, solid, and versatile. It has room for nine racks worth of hardware, a two-tier work surface, and a slide-out tray for my MIDI controllers.

### And what software?

If I'm doing [Ruby][], I do it in both [Atom][] and [BBEdit][] (I love the regex support in BBEdit and I've been using it since 1995!) For [Go][], I use [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code]; I'm fairly new to Go so I appreciate the help that an IDE gives me, and there are some great plugins for debugging and testing, too. For [Swift][swift.2] I use [Xcode][]. Some people might look down on me for using GUIs but I am a very visual person and I don't mind lifting my fingers off the keyboard from time to time. In the studio I use [Logic X][logic] and adore it.

### What would be your dream setup?

I wouldn't change a thing about my physical space. I work from home, which is great, and my desk is in a sunroom that is pretty much all windows (west-facing so I can see the gorgeous sunset at the end of my day.) I love my hardware setup but I would be even happier with two 42.5" 4k displays, one on either side of my laptop. Preferably on adjustable mounts. In the studio I would love to have a maxed-out 27" [iMac][] dedicated to music production --- even my MacBook Pro has trouble keeping up with Logic at a decent sample rate. My Patreon is at... just kidding. Sort of.
