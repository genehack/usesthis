### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Flula](http://www.flulaborg.com/ "Flula's website."), and I am a Musiking-Actoring-Journalisting-Writering-Hosting-Hypeman Dude. Also, I am a Large Lover of Explorings and Adventures and yes, Cookies.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] Core i7 for my Brain-Storming of [Not-Spell-Checked Novels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pqwRwLG7J8 "Flula's YouTube video where he finishes a 50,000 word novel."), [Songs about Disc Jockeying Dinosaurs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyMlfTM9-48 "Flula's YouTube of his Dinosaur DJ song."), and also Rekordings of my Father nibbling Spätzle.

For my Musik making times, [I use my Homo Sapien Vokal Chords installed by my Father and Mother in 1982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-VM5wqzhWY "Flula's YouTube video of his song with his parents."), a [Electro-Harmonix 2880 multi-track looper][2880], a [Line 6 DL4 Delay Modeler][dl4], a [Novation Launchpad Mini][launchpad-mini], and other Items such as 16 Chop-Sticks which I have taped together to make cool slap sounds for my sassi Beats.  

For Audios I use a [H4n ZOOM Recorder][h4n] and a [SM58 Mikrofone][sm58] to catch the Magik of real Sounds to insert in my Tracks, and into your Heart.

For Notes and Ideas I use a Leuchtturm 1917 Medium Notebook, the [iPhone 6][iphone-6] [Notes][notes-ios] app, and also my Cousin Rudi's Back (Sharpies do make long lists on his Skin).

For Filming I use mostly a iPhone 6, [GoPro Hero2][hd-hero2] and [Hero4][hero4-black], and a [Canon T4i][eos-650d] with [18-135mm EF-S IS STM lens][ef-s-18-135mm-f3.5-5.6-is-stm], and a [Canon EOS C300][eos-c300].

### And what software?

For my Music I use Old Schools Software like 2006 [Garageband][], 1998 version of [Ejay][], but also [Novation Launchpad for iPad][launchpad-ios], and also new things like [Logic][].

For Video Editing I am still loving [Final Cut Pro][final-cut-pro] v7.

For Editing of [strange Fotos and Images](https://www.instagram.com/p/7V_ckdgpYU/ "Flula's Instagram photo of him in labour.") I do love [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator] and [Photoshop][] CS.

### What would be your dream setup?

In my Dream Setup of Life, I would have 5 friendly Robots filming me 25 Hours in the Day. Also, one of these Robots is a Chef who is feeding me delishus Purèe of Broccoli and Yogurt and Pasta. Also one of the Robots is sleeping for me, so I do not need sleep, and one of the Robots does hug me all Day so am feeling enough Affection for the Day.
