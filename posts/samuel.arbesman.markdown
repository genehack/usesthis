### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Sam Arbesman](http://arbesman.net/ "Samuel's website.") and I'm a complexity scientist and writer. I'm currently a senior scholar at the [Kauffman Foundation](http://www.kauffman.org/ "The Kauffman Foundation.") and a fellow at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/ "The social science research department of Harvard."). I conduct research related to computational social science, such as how scientific discovery works and the nature of cities, and I also do a whole lot of popular writing, which appears in such places as [*Wired*](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/socialdimension/ "Samuel's articles on Wired.") and [*The Atlantic*](http://www.theatlantic.com/samuel-arbesman/ "Samuel's articles in The Atlantic."). My first book [*The Half-Life of Facts*](http://halflifeoffacts.com/ "Samuel's book.") was published last year.

### What hardware do you use?

My hardware is a reasonably straightforward setup. My primary computer is an 11-inch [MacBook Air][macbook-air] with 4 gigs of RAM. In my office I have a 28-inch Apple Monitor, a Bluetooth [Apple Keyboard][keyboard], and a [Magic Mouse][magic-mouse]. I also have a 13-inch [MacBook][] from 2007 that is nearly decommissioned, but aside for a battery that's dead, works well.

And I have an [iPhone 4S][iphone-4s]. I was an extremely late adopter of a smart phone, and only got one in late 2011, after my colleagues poked fun at my basic flip phone, which was overly simple and out-of-date even four years earlier when I first got it. This late adoption is prevalent in most of my technological life when it comes to hardware: I got a [Kindle][] five years after its release and only got a DVD player when it was given to me for free.

### And what software?

For my research and programming, most of my work is done in the language of [Python][], supplemented by [scipy][], [numpy][], and [networkx][] packages. I use a combination of the [Terminal][] and [TextWrangler][] for this. Also [R][]. I was recently introduced to [Sublime Text 2][sublime-text], which is supposed to be amazing, though I haven't yet gotten the hang of it.

For my writing, I use several tools, depending on the project. For scientific papers, I use [TeXShop][], which is a great implementation of [LaTeX][]. For shorter popular writing, I use [Microsoft Word][word]. And for longer writing projects, such as books, I use [Scrivener][]. Scrivener is an incredible writing tool and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It allows me to chunk up my ideas, rearrange them, throw huge amounts of notes and other background material into a single file (and organize it well), and compile this whole mess into a document my editors find acceptable. For my management of citations and bibliography, I use [Mendeley][], which is a really good free program that can work with both Word and LaTeX.

For data visualization, I use [gephi][] for networks, an amazingly powerful tool which many describe as "[Photoshop][] for networks." For graphs and data plots, I use a somewhat unwieldy and defunct undiscovered gem called [Plot 0.997][plot].

For social media, my Twitter life occurs in [YoruFukurou][] on my desktop and, secondarily, in [Echofon][echofon-ios] on my iPhone. YoruFukurou (which apparently means "Night Owl" in Japanese) is extremely powerful for filtering and reading tweets, but doesn't overwhelm me with information. I use [NetNewsWire][] for the rapidly dwindling number of RSS feeds that I still follow (fewer than ten), as Twitter has supplanted my webpage discovery process.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm pretty happy with what I have. But I do know that any setup I choose would not involve holding my hands out in front of me, like in [*Minority Report*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film) "A movie about precognition in the future."). This seems exhausting.
