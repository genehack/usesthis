### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Polina Fearon. I am a Belarusian-Canadian [illustrator and visual designer](http://polinafearon.com/ "Polina's website.") and mom of two little boys! I started attending art school at the age of four and graduated with a Bachelor Degree of fine arts in [Technical and Scientific illustration](https://www.behance.net/gallery/714072/Technical-and-Scientific-Illustration "Polina's scientific illustration gallery on Behance."). I've had the pleasure of applying my design and illustration skills to all kinds of projects and for a wide range of clients. I've worked at an agency as a Designer at [Fuel Industries](https://www.fuelyouth.com/ "A creative agency in Canada.") in Ottawa, Canada, a UI artist at a mobile gaming company in SF ([Pocket Gems](https://pocketgems.com/ "A games company in San Francisco.")) and a Visual Designer for [Idean](https://www.idean.com/ "A UX agency in Finland."), a Finnish UX agency, in the Bay Area.

I've been able to pick up all kinds of visual design, illustration and UX skills along the way. Currently, I am a stay-at-home mom who spends her free time doing freelance work and creating [a children's book](https://www.behance.net/gallery/38186033/Russian-Alphabet-Boardbook "Polina's alphabet book gallery on Behance.") and [illustrations](https://www.instagram.com/polinafearonart/ "Polina's Instagram account.").

### What hardware do you use?

Typically all of my traditional and digital work starts out the same way -  in a Moleskin sketchbook or on a piece of paper of some sort. I'm a firm believer in starting out with exploration through drawing and sketching, before moving on to the computer. For my digital work I either scan or take a photo with my [iPhone 7 Plus][iphone-7-plus] of the final sketch, and after that I move on to my [13" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], which I sometimes hook up to a 27" monitor. I also only use a [Medium Wacom Intuos Pro][intuos-pro] when I work - no mice or track pads.

My traditional media pieces can be a mix of [Prismacolor pencil crayons][premier-soft-core] and watercolor, pen and ink on mylar, [Staedtler fineliner][pigment-liner-308] or acrylic paint. My illustration work is often a mix of digital and traditional media. 

### And what software?

I often use [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop] and [Illustrator][] for my illustration and design work. [InDesign][] comes in handy for books and other print projects. For web design I will also use [Sketch][], although I will often use Photoshop and Illustrator for this as well. [Spotify][] is usually on while I work.

### What would be your dream setup?

I would love to have a little studio set up in my home with an easel, a drafting table and a wooden desk (which my husband [Dave](http://davefearon.com/ "Dave's website.") has promised to build for me) for my future [iMac][] and my Wacom tablet. I'd love to have a large scanner and a printer, which, in my dream, would never run out of ink!

My studio would also feature a giant window with some sort of body of water outside and a comfy couch, where I can use my sketchbook and [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] for research and drawing and gaze outside. I would also love some framed art and family photos in the room, for inspiration. 

Ideally I would also like a shelving unit to help organize art supplies, canvases and paper and to help hide the general chaos.
