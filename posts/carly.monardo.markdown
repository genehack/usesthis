### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Carly Monardo](https://www.carlymonardo.com/ "Carly's website."), and I'm an artist and performer from New York. I've been working professionally as an artist for well over a decade, in animation, publishing, game design, tech, and more! Notable clients include: Adult Swim; Cartoon Network; Flatiron Books; Hulu; Marvel Comics; Nick Jr.; Saatchi & Saatchi.

I'm also a performer, having years of experience doing improv and sketch comedy at NYC theaters and festivals across the country. Currently I'm a cast member of [Rude Tales of Magic](https://www.rudetalesofmagic.com/ "An adventure play podcast."), a narrative play podcast AV Club called "Best New Voice in Actual Play Podcasting".

### What hardware do you use?

I work on a 21.5" [iMac][], set up as a dual monitor with my [Cintiq 22HD display][cintiq]. I also work on a 12.9" [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] with [Apple Pencil][pencil]. 

For podcast recording, while our studio is inaccessible, I record on a Shure USB microphone. I had a set of earbuds I really liked from LSTN but I lost them during the pandemic when I started working remotely.

### And what software?

I work predominantly in [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop], but I use a lot of the [Creative Cloud][creative-cloud] apps: [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro], [After Effects][after-effects], [InDesign][]. For animating in Photoshop I like the [AnimDessin2][] extension created by St√©phane Baril, and I use [ToonBoom's Storyboard Pro][storyboard-pro] for storyboarding. I also use [Procreate][procreate-ios] on my iPad, though I haven't gotten into animating on their timeline yet. 

Our podcast records remotely using [Zencastr][] to capture audio and [Zoom][zoom.2] to see each other's faces! Any time I pitch in to edit audio I use [Adobe Audition][audition], sometimes [Audacity][].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm generally very happy with my digital setup, but I'd love to have a dedicated studio space one day where I could set up a screen printing press and have an exposure unit for screens, an acetate printer, the whole nine. Also a space where I could do stick and poke tattoos. I so rarely get to work with my hands in that way!

I'm also very eager for the time when me and my Rude Tales cast-mates can return to our studio. It's a very happy place for me.
