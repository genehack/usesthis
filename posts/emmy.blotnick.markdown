### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a comedian and writer. Most recently I've written for [@midnight with Chris Hardwick](http://www.cc.com/shows/-midnight "A celebrity comedy TV show.") and now [Not Safe with Nikki Glaser](http://press.cc.com/press-release/2015/06/02/press-comedy-central-orders-not-safe-with-nikki-glaser-to-series "A press release about the Nikki Glaser TV show."), which will be on Comedy Central soon. I do standup all over the place and host a show at UCB Theater called [Big Long Sets](https://franklin.ucbtheatre.com/show/5319 "Emmy's comedy theatre show."). I post show info and jokes and stuff on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emmyblotnick "Emmy's Twitter account.") if you're interested.

### What hardware do you use?

Currently I have a [13" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] from 2OO8 that has a broken zero key. When I need to type a zero, I Google "Andre 3" and let it autocomplete the "thousand," then I copy-paste one of his zeroes. It's a terrific use of time. (Finding an end parenthesis is a little trickier.]

For standup, I like these 6x8" hardcover notebooks from Pearl River Mart. I've gone through about 2O of them. They're a little uglier than Moleskines, but a lot cheaper, which is good -- that way you don't think twice about tearing pages out or writing something really stupid. Their slogan should be The Notebook You Can Disrespect.

### And what software?

[Microsoft Word][word], [TextEdit][], the [Notes app][notes-ios] on the iPhone, [Google Docs][google-docs]. I also email myself a lot of notes and reminders. (I realize it looks a little weird when I have an inbox full of emails from myself, but guess how many fucks I give? Oh right, no zero key.]

### What would be your dream setup?

Good speakers so I can listen to shitty pop music and someone to shame me out of taking so many trips to the kitchen.
