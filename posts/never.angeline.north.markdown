### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Never Angeline Nørth](https://undying.club/ "Never's website."), I'm co-founder and lead designer of [Undying Apparel](http://apparel.undying.club/ "Never's clothing line."). I also write and design books, create visual art and do the occasional tattoo. For my day job I'm Data Management Director at a local LGBTQ+ non-profit.

### What hardware do you use?

I have a [Dell Latitude E6230 laptop][latitude-e6230] with a broken screen that I have turned into a desktop thanks to a cheap wireless keyboard and mouse and a wide format monitor that I salvaged from a pile of old tech a friend was going to throw away. I draw on a [Huion H610PRO tablet][inspiroy-h610pro].

### And what software?

[Google Docs][google-docs] for most of my writing, though I just transferred my current novel-in-progress to [Scrivener][] and it's helped a lot with structuring it. I use [Notepad++][notepad-plusplus] to design and edit the Undying Apparel website, [Cyberduck][] to upload it, [Photoshop][] 2020 to make shirt designs and any digital art, and [InDesign][] 2019 for book layouts. For my day job it's all Google Docs, [Google Sheets][google-sheets], and [Google Meet][google-meet]. Oh and [Habitica][] to keep me on task and manage my to-do list.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to get a [Surface Book 2][surface-book-2] or some other kind of laptop/tablet combo so I was a little more mobile with my design work (and, lately, my writing work, since I can't use Scrivener on my phone).
