### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Winona Nelson](http://www.winonanelsonart.com/ "Winona's website."), and I'm an artist working in illustration and video game concept art. Clients I've worked with include Magic: The Gathering and Naughty Dog.

### What hardware do you use?

I work in more than one medium - digital and oil paint. I'll start with the digital tools: I have both a desktop at home, and a laptop computer to paint with when I travel. The desktop machine is a Dell [Precision Tower 5810][precision-tower-5810] with one 27 inch Dell LCD monitor and one 23.6 inch Asus LCD monitor, and a Wacom [Intuos4 Medium tablet][intuos]. My mobile setup is an Asus Pro [B9440UA][] laptop and a Wacom [Intuos Pro Small][intuos-pro]. It's an odd laptop - I had to prioritize weight for my travel machine because being a smallish woman and with an old shoulder injury, I can't carry much on my back or in a shoulder bag, and I travel a lot. I needed something light and small, with a matte screen after my last laptop's glossy screen was impossible to work on in any but the dimmest environments. The reason I use a tablet rather than a Cintiq or similar tablet screen is that I grew up painting digitally and prefer not having my hand in front of what I'm doing. I wish I could make my hand invisible when I oil paint too!

As for my oil paint setup, I like both Blick and Ampersand gessoed masonite surfaces. I apply a layer of Gamblin Fastmatte Titanium White to the surface before painting to speed drying time. The brand of paint I use varies by color. Most are Gamblin, some Windsor and Newton, some Old Holland, some Williamsburg and some Michael Harding. For my medium I like Neo Megilp as well as a mixture of Damar varnish, stand oil, and turpenoid. My favorite brushes are Princeton Umbria flats. I use a standing easel and an anti-fatigue mat while I paint, and I've attached an iPad holder arm to my easel and use an [iPad][] to display reference material.

### And what software?

[Photoshop][], currently CC 2019. Every once in a while I use [SketchUp][] to help with perspective in backgrounds. 

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm mostly happy with what I have right now. I'm planning to upgrade the RAM to and video card in my desktop system sometime soon. Maybe a new monitor too. For my laptop I've already got one of the smallest and lightest ones that can run the software I need, but the screen could be better. I'll probably upgrade again in a couple years and will see what's available then. It does seem like there have been some interesting developments in the ultralight category. 

For my traditional media work, someday I'd like a studio with a high ceiling and a Hughes easel.
