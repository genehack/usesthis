### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Robyn](https://twitter.com/haykebyr "Robyn's Twitter account."), my pronouns are she/her, and I am a mid-twenty-something just out here doing my best! I am a graphic designer by trade, went to college for it and have a passion for it and am fortunate to be able to do it as a job, and in my free time I love to draw and make art! I have been artistically inclined since I was just a tot, and have stuck with it in various ways throughout my whole life. Art is core to who I am and it brings me so much joy in so many ways!

### What hardware do you use?

For graphic design I just use whatever laptop I happen to have at the time, I've never been overly picky about specs, but currently I have a 5-year-old [Dell XPS 15 9560][xps-15-9560]. I got it in college and it has held up extremely well and can run all those big programs just fine.

And for drawing, since I'm primarily a digital artist, I almost exclusively use a [Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+][galaxy-tab-s7-plus]. Before that I was using a [13in Wacom Cintiq][cintiq], but a few years ago I decided to try using a more portable tablet and got the [Galaxy Tab S4][galaxy-tab-s4], as I wanted a less expensive, non-Apple alternative to the iPad. I've absolutely loved having such an easy and readily accessible digital art option, it's encouraged me to draw more than ever before, so I upgraded to the S7+ last year to have a bigger screen to work with and it was definitely worth the investment.

### And what software?

For graphic design: the [Adobe Suite][creative-suite], and more recently, [Affinity Designer][affinity-designer] (still learning it, but it's pretty great!)

For drawing: [Clip Studio Paint][clip-studio-paint]! I was exclusively drawing in [Photoshop][] basically since I started digital art when I was like 10, but when I got my S4 I used a cheap but quite good app called [ArtFlow][], and then when I got my S7+ I invested in Clip Studio Paint since their mobile version is really robust and comprehensive. It was a bit of a learning curve but it is absolutely amazing and I love it as an art program!

### What would be your dream setup?

Right now the specs for everything I'm using work really well for me, so ideally I think just having a nice desk setup and space to work would be great. I'd love to have a permanent setup for my laptop/monitor, as well as have space for my drawing tablet and room to do other hobby things like painting and crafty stuff. Right now, I have a tiny desk for my work setup that I have to switch out to use my personal laptop, and I usually end up drawing on my bed or on the floor, so just having more room to spread out with dedicated space for everything would be great... I'll get there someday!! :)
