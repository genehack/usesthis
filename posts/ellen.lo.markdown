### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I am [Ellen](https://ellenlowing.com/ "Ellen's website."). I am a freelance creative technologist and dancer based in Brooklyn. When I am not making websites, I am working on [this series](https://www.instagram.com/codebrewed/ "Ellen's Instagram account about Chinese characters and Hong Kong.") about Chinese characters and Hong Kong.

Before COVID-19, I was also working at HYPNO, where I designed an [RFID scanner](https://hypno.com/c/color-factory-htx "Ellen's RFID scanner project at HYPNO.") + [iOS][] integration flow, developed a motion-triggered camera app for a slide, and made a [face filter](https://instagram.com/a/r/?effect_id=512224676011992 "Ellen's Instagram filter (requires the app).").

### What hardware do you use?

For the first LED installation I did in 2018, [Fluid](https://axismundi.info/pages/fluid/index.html "Ellen's LED installation."), I used a Garmin [LiDAR-Lite sensor][lidar-lite-v3] and an [Arduino Uno][arduino-uno] to calculate viewers' distance and filtered out noise in [TouchDesigner][touchdesigner]. To keep the playback on the LEDs in sync, I used Syphon to share textures with the [PixelPusher][] interface. 

Before the lockdown in NYC, I was doing [ARKit][] dev with an [iPad Pro 12.9"][ipad-pro]. For lights and electronics stuff, Adafruit [HUZZAH32][] is my go-to board for prototyping, but the Arduino Uno is easier sometimes because I use the [Ethernet Shield][ethernet-shield-2] and [DMX Shield][dmx-shield] a lot. If USB is available, the ENTTEC [DMX USB Pro Mk2][dmx-usb-pro-mk2] is the least confusing DMX interface to me that does both send/receive. For the RFID scanner, I used a [Raspberry Pi 3B+][raspberry-pi-3b-plus] and the [ACM1252U-Y3 module][acm1252u-y3].

In my experience, Kinect for Windows on PC running TouchDesigner is the only answer to Kinect skeleton mapping. Otherwise, a [MacBook Pro 13"][macbook-pro] (2019) and [Kinect][] V1 is okay for a home setup, only when absolutely necessary. ðŸ¤ 

### And what software?

I am language agnostic â€“ I've used [Matter.js][], [p5.js][], [Three.js][], [Hanzi Writer][hanzi-writer], [OpenCV][], [openFrameworks][], and [ShaderToy][], but it's been mostly the good old [Processing][] for sketches. And I usually end up creating my own tools to do things like extract outline and signed distance functions of Chinese characters. Sometimes I add feedback with TouchDesigner to get the extra procedural look. Then I use [QuickTime][quicktime-pro] to record my screen and document the sketch. 

[Atom][] is my default text editor, if I am not using any IDEs. [Tower][] is a great [Git][] client, but I also just like to stick to the command line when developing my own projects. 

For website stuff, I use [Safari Technology Preview][safari-technology-preview] to prototype and check for responsiveness. [Sketch][] is my favorite when designers do dev handoff. I use [GitHub Pages][github-pages] to share prototypes. When a CMS is needed for a project I've been using [WordPress][], but I'm looking to explore other prettier options.

### What would be your dream setup?

A Sketch plugin that returns CSS code in viewport units. A physical notebook that lets me cmd+f ðŸ¤–. A custom EEG headset that would put up a Do Not Disturb sign for me whenever my brain activity is high (when working with people.)
