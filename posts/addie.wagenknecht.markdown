### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Addie Wagenknecht, I'm an [artist](http://www.placesiveneverbeen.com/ "Addie's website.") and [sort of a writer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/addiewagenknecht/ "Addie's writing on Forbes.") and my major vices are coffee, dogs, chocolate and [travel](https://instagram.com/wheresaddie/ "Addie's Instagram account.") -- I live for traveling -- not in the sense of 5 star hotels, although those are amazing too, but dirt roads not on [Google Maps][google-maps], befriending stray animals to share dinner with and camping on the beach in Mozambique.

### What hardware do you use?

Depends on what I am making. My laptop is probably my most used hardware -- it's a [Lenovo X1 carbon][thinkpad-x1-carbon] -- and my [Pixel 2][pixel-2] phone is what I use for every image or video I make.

### And what software?

I use mostly FLOSS/FOSS software on [Ubuntu][] -- I have a love/hate relationship with [GIMP][] and [Inkscape][]. I really had to relearn how to do everything when I switched from [OS X][macos] 12 years ago. I really found it horrible and painful when I was used to everything Adobe.

### What would be your dream setup?

I recently lost my studio, so I'm working from my couch and kitchen table everyday, so my dream setup would be a real space I can work in again, and mess up the floors, and leave projects out and everywhere without having to think about the dog stepping on them or eating stuff... :) I'd love a big warehouse that's well heated -- like, Mark Bradford's studio looks amazing, or like [Picasso's Cannes studio](https://theartstack.com/artist/pablo-picasso/his-cannes-studio-1956 "An ArtStack article about Picasso.") -- somewhere I can escape to and not be bothered. 

I really have dreams about having unlimited space and materials to experiment with, without having to think about where it's going to dry or be stored...
