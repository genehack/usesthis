### Who are you, and what do you do?

[Ben Lee](https://www.ben-lee.com/ "Ben's website."). Musician. Singer/songwriter. Producer. Composer. Professional adventurer. Activist. Pursuer and celebrator of wild ideas.

### What hardware do you use?

Guitars. At the moment an old Guild I bought in 1996 and have never been able to get away from, and then a [Maton EBG808][egb808] for alternate tunings. A notebook. A laptop. My phone. A couple of good mics. I love my Wunder Audio 047 copy. I have an [Apogee Duet interface][duet]. I go through phases of having more or less equipment. I didn't bring much out to Sydney from LA so things are pretty minimal right now.

### And what software?

[Pro Tools][pro-tools].

### What would be your dream setup?

Everyone wants more options, but I'm not sure that ultimately helps. The "dream" has always just been a guitar that feels good, that I connect with, and a voice-box that works. I've got those now. So I guess I'm living the dream.
