### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am the co-founder of [the Relay FM podcast network.](https://www.relay.fm/ "A podcast network.") We are home to nearly 30 nerdy podcasts ranging from covering companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft to talking about design and development. We have a show about the space industry and another about fountain pens.

That last bit isn't a joke, I promise.

My time is split between [hosting several podcasts](https://www.relay.fm/people/stephenhackett "Stephen's podcasts on Relay.") on the network and running the business side of things with my co-founder.  

My side project is writing my blog, which is named [512 Pixels,](https://512pixels.net/ "Stephen's website.") and hosting videos on its spin-off [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g "Stephen's YouTube channel.") The site is ten years old, and I can't imagine my life without sharing nerdy stuff on it at this point.

My side side project is building a pretty extensive collection of Macintosh computers. Many of my machines have been featured on 512 Pixels over the years. Also featured on the site: [my dogcow tattoo.](https://512pixels.net/dogcow/ "Stephen's article about Clarus the Dogcow.") 

I live in my hometown of Memphis, TN with my wife, our three children, a dog and a Roomba.

### What hardware do you use?

The heart of my setup is an entry-level [iMac Pro][imac-pro]. I converted from the latop-and-a-big-screen lifestyle when I built my studio in 2016, but always wanted more power than the 5K iMac could provide.

My notebook is a 2018 13-inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], and I carry whatever the newest iPhone is at the moment. Right now, it's an [iPhone X][iphone-x] that is *real* scratched up.

I record my podcasts using a [Shure 87A][beta-87a] XLR microphone with a shock mount, on the [K&M 23850 Microphone Desk Arm.][23850] The microphone is plugged into [a Rolls mute switch,][ms111] then into [a Sound Devices USBPre 2 interface,][usbpre-2] via a [Schiit Wyrd.][wyrd]

I use the boring-but-reliable [Sony MDR-7506 headphones][mdr-7506] with Schiit's [Magni 2 headphone amp.][magni-2] 

That's a pretty expensive setup for podcasting, but hey, it's my job and my CPA said it was cool.

On the video side, I am shooting in 4K on a [Sony Î±7r II][a7r-ii] I bought second-hand from a friend. 4K looks awesome, and with the iMac Pro, I can edit it without wanting to throw my computer out the window. I have a couple of lenses and a shotgun mic for it as well.

In my front left pocket, there is always a Field Notes notebook, with a [Uni-ball Jetstream Ballpoint Pen][jetstream-sport-0.7] clipped to it.

### And what software?

I'm all-in on [macOS.][macos]

I record my audio (and audio from Skype) using [Audio Hijack Pro,][audio-hijack-pro] with [Ecamm Call Recorder][call-recorder] running as a backup. I edit in [Logic Pro X.][logic-pro]

On the video side, I edit in [Final Cut Pro X][final-cut-pro-x] because one time I opened [Premiere][] and got scared.

As far as writing, I am currently creating [Markdown][] in [iA Writer][ia-writer], with copious amounts of research saved in Apple's [Notes][] app.

### What would be your dream setup?

As great as my iMac Pro is, I'd love to live in a world where I could have this much power in a Mac notebook that docked into a big display when I get to the studio. Basically, [the PowerBook Duo.](https://www.macstories.net/mac/three-tiny-laptops/ "A MacStories article about three small laptops.")
