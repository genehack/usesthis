### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Lauren Cason](https://www.laurencason.com/ "Lauren's website."). In my [personal work](https://www.laurencason.com/face-filters-1 "Lauren's AR filters."), I make AR filters. In a previous life, I worked as an artist in games, including [Monument Valley 2][monument-valley-2], [Luna][luna.2], and [Where the Water Tastes Like Wine][where-the-water-tastes-like-wine]. Now, I'm the XR Creative Director at Meow Wolf. Currently, I'm really interested in digital adornment. We've seen the beginning of it with [Snapchat][] filters, and I'm excited about how this technology can be leveraged to create artful, thoughtful, provoking things that go beyond smoothing our skin or enlarging our eyes.

### What hardware do you use?

- Moleskine dot matrix hardback notebook. I have terrible handwriting and like that I can have a guide with the matrix but it's not as intrusive as a lined notebook for sketching.
- Lenovo ThinkPad for my laptop. 
- [iPad Pro 2][ipad-pro] for drawing, texture painting and meetings.
- Wacom [Cintiq Pro][cintiq-pro] 24 for Serious Business Painting and Sculpting at work.
- All The Headsets at work. We did a big Magic Leap site specific play earlier this year, and a [HoloLens][] experience before that. 
- Microsoft [Surface Mobile Mouse][surface-mobile-mouse]. I love this mouse. I can get it in my favorite color. It's also small - I have little hands so I hate a giant mouse, and it has the nice sleek feel of an Apple [Magic Mouse][magic-mouse] but I still have a scroll wheel. Best mouse.

### And what software?

- [Unity][] for game engine.
- [Maya][] for modeling.
- [Zbrush][] for sculpting.
- [Procreate][procreate-ios] for painting and sketching.
- [Photoshop][] for texture work and some specific things that procreate cant do, but honestly I would love to get to the point where I can do most of my work on my iPad.
- [VS Code][visual-studio-code] for programming.
- [Spark AR][spark-ar-studio] for filter work, and I'm exploring [Lens Studio][lens-studio].

### What would be your dream setup?
I'm a big fan of Apple hardware - I wish I could have a [MacBook][macbook.2] as my main XR development laptop, and my iPad Pro as all I needed for drawing. The iPad is almost there, there's just a couple things I need Photoshop for still. I still can't use a lot of headsets very effectively with a Mac though, so, someday hopefully! If it were just those two I would be so mobile! That would be my dream, actual mobility with this sort of work, and not being quite so tied to my desk.
