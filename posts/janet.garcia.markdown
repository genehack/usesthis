### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Janet Garcia (aka Gameonysus) and I'm an independent game critic and content creator. I stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gameonysus "Janet's Twitch account."), podcast ([Gameonysus Weekly](https://gameonysusweekly.transistor.fm/ "Janet's gaming news podcast."), [The MinnMax Show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiUhKqsBH-Is2VeC2sykEfg "A gaming show on YouTube."), guest features), and [write articles/reviews](https://pentopixels.com/ "Janet's game reviews and articles."). All my work is supported through [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Gameonysus "Janet's Patreon account.").

### What hardware do you use?

I have an NZXT Streaming PC with the following specs: [AMD Ryzen 9 3900X][ryzen-9-3900x] 12-core processor (3.79 GHz), 32 GB of RAM, [GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER][geforce-rtx-2070-super], and 1 TB of storage. I use an internal capture card, specifically the [AVerMedia Live Gamer DUO][live-gamer-duo]. Everything is viewed across my 4 monitor setup featuring an ASUS gaming monitor, an LG, and 2 HPs.
 
Since all my content creation is based on games there's plenty of gaming hardware at work. For modern consoles and peripherals, I have a [PS5][], [Xbox Series X][xbox-series-x], [Nintendo Switch][switch.2], and [Oculus Quest][quest]. Older hardware is in my home but rarely gets used for content.

### And what software?

I'm sure I'll miss a few types but for software I use [Google Chrome][chrome] for browsing even though it takes up way too much power. For communication, I'm using [Slack][] and [Discord][]. For music, I'm using the [Spotify][] app on every device I have. I stream and record podcasts using [Streamlabs OBS][obs-studio], [NVIDIA Broadcast][broadcast] (for camera blur and mic filtration), and occasionally [Audacity][] for audio recording. 
 
My videos, including my podcast, get edited in [Adobe Premiere][premiere] and I use [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop], [Figma][], and [Canva][] for editing thumbnails and creating other art assets. 
 
And of course, every game I play is another piece of software used to do my work.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to have a proper studio space that's completely separate from my bedroom. Here's what that space would have in addition to my current, 4 monitored desk. I'd like a designated space for standing straight-to-cam shots with a teleprompter and a sofa for more casual conversation formats. Additionally, I'd like to have an area for mixed-reality VR streaming. Lastly, I'd like to have a craft area where I can have my planner and stationery organized. 

Planning, on paper, plays a big role in my content and workflow so having a dedicated space for it would be relaxing and efficient.
