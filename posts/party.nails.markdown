### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Party Nails (real name is Elana), a pop and electronic musician from Los Angeles. I like to write, sing, guitar it up, use computers etc. You can find my music on [Spotify][], [Apple Music][apple-music] and other digital stores. My [Instagram][] is [@partypartynails](https://www.instagram.com/partypartynails/ "The Party Nails Instagram account.") and my website is [partypartynails.com](https://www.partypartynails.com/ "The official Party Nails website.").

### What hardware do you use?

It's important to use a good preamp. I'm not yet able to invest in my own, but I regularly borrow a [LA-610][la-610-mkii] and [Distressors][distressor]. 

### And what software?

I use [Ableton][live], [Pro Tools][pro-tools] and [Logic][], in that order. I often write in Ableton and then do vocals in Pro Tools. There are a few native plugins in Logic that I think are unmatched, but I don't enjoy using it for the whole process of record making. Also my friends who mix use Pro Tools, so by having the session already set up for them we save time.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be exactly what I have, PLUS some older hardware reverbs, a [Moog DFAM][dfam], a [POG][] and [Fender Deluxe][deluxe] and a [St. Vincent guitar][st-vincent] (how fun would that be!!??), [P-Bass][precision-bass], and a [VoiceLive Touch][voicelive-touch-2]. I'm sure there are some other fun things but this would be plenty :) It would be fun to play with one of [these][monomachine-sfx-60] or one of [these][machinedrum-sps-1] for a while.
