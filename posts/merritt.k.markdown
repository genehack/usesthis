### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [merritt k](http://merrittk.com/ "merritt's website."). With my producer Nic Bravo, I run a podcast network called [Stay Mean](https://staymean.co/ "A podcast network.") and host a [couple](http://woodlandsecrets.co/ "merritt's conversation podcast.") of [shows](http://dadfeelings.com/ "merritt's podcast about father-type figures."). With Daniel Shannon, I'm a part of [Ignota Media](https://ignota.media/ "A publishing group for underrepresented voices."), a publishing endeavour for and by underrepresented voices. And sometimes I write about internet culture, relationships, and labour --- right now I have a column at [MEL Magazine](https://melmagazine.com/@merritt_k "merritt's articles in MEL Magazine.").

### What hardware do you use?

I spend most of my day on a [2011 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that I bought for $400 from an acquaintance in 2014 and upgraded with the help of Stay Mean producer Nic Bravo. I will likely continue using it until it becomes untenable. The same goes for my [iPhone 5C][iphone-5c]. For reasons that are partly necessity and partly a bizarre form of self-flagellation, I am not the kind of person who replaces things on a regular schedule. 

When recording, I speak into an [Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB mic][atr2100-usb] on a [RODE PSA1 boom arm][psa1] and monitor with Sony MDR-7506 monitor headphones. I record and do most other work on a cheap IKEA desk in the closet of my small Crown Heights bedroom.

### And what software?

For episodes with guests, I use Skype with [Ecamm's Skype Call Recorder][call-recorder] to grab my side of the call and a backup of the guest's. For solo episodes, I use [Piezo][]. I use [VLC][] to review episodes and [TextWrangler][] to write show notes in [Markdown][]. I also write in TextWrangler, though I've been experimenting with [Cold Turkey Writer][cold-turkey-writer]. I'm trying to do less writing in [Google Docs][google-docs] because I'm touchy about losing access to my work, but it's still how I communicate with my editor about revisions. My producer and I share files, solicit file uploads, and take notes using [Dropbox][] and [Dropbox Paper][dropbox-paper]. Finally, I have Cold Turkey set up on a schedule to keep me offline in the morning when I do my best writing.

I've become a religious [OmniFocus][] user thanks to my friend Henry Faber. I use the contexts feature along with blocks of time set aside in my calendar to work on different kinds of tasks --- writing, communication, research --- throughout the day, rather than dedicating time to specific projects. Without this division of time (and let's be honest, even with it), it's too easy to just be _kind_ of working 24/7, a very stressful but not incredibly productive arrangement. 

Daniel and I use [Asana][] to coordinate on our work, since OmniFocus doesn't support shared projects. We also use [Slack][] and [1Password][], the latter of which I use at Stay Mean and in my day-to-day, though I still sync my vaults over Dropbox rather than using the 1Password subscription service.

I was running [CrashPlan][] --- which I loved --- until they discontinued the personal user service, at which point I switched to [Backblaze][]. I also regularly back up to an on-site Seagate external drive.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm not interested in a maximalist audio setup, and my machine still runs fine, so I'd be happy with a recording space/office outside of my home, a slightly nicer mic, and a hardware audio mixer.
