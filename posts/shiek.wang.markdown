### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Shiek Wang](https://twitter.com/shiekthegeek "Shiek's Twitter account."), I am an art director at Bungie for the FPS loot shooter game [Destiny 2][destiny-2].

### What hardware do you use?

Currently with WFH during these pandemic times I am using a fairly simple HP laptop that I can VPN remote into work and log in to various cloud-based services the studio uses. I have a very small [Wacom Bamboo tablet][bamboo] that I use to do draw over and paintovers. This set up allows me to be very mobile which lets me be with my family and still do productive work.

### And what software?

Primary software of choice is [Photoshop CS6][photoshop], because I find it runs better standalone than on the cloud. That is the main art tool I use for creating visual guides/briefs/feedbacks. We also use [ShotGrid][] a lot to track content version iterations, give feedback, and maintain alignment across departments. There's many other pieces of software, but those are either proprietary (like engine tools) or cloud-based ([Office][], [Stadia][], [Confluence][]).

### What would be your dream setup?

Feels like WFH has changed my perspective on what this is. I used to want a giant [Cintiq][] that's a minimum of 24" to do my art and be a monitor, but now I find being nimble and mobile to be more advantageous for a balanced work and life split. I don't think what I want exists but if I could dream, I'd like AR glasses that project monitor screens that I can adjust according to my object space, and a simple keyboard and tablet I can carry around. This doesn't exist yet, but should!
