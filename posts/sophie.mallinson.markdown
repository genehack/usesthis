### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Sophie Mallinson](https://sophiemallinson.com/ "Sophie's website."), I'm a writer and narrative designer. That's a niche job in the games industry that's all about helping every part of a video game - environments, mechanics, interfaces, sound - support the story and creative vision.

I've worked for companies like Arkane Studios, Magnopus, and Electronic Arts. I also have a background in localization, translating mobile mystery games from French to English. My favourite projects inspire hope and celebrate unique perspectives.

I enjoy cooking, solving puzzles, and writing fiction in my spare time.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a work-issued [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (16-inch, 2019) that runs [Catalina][macos]. My phone is an [iPhone XR][iphone-xr] in Coral. I also have a custom-built computer in a [Corsair 380T Mini-ITX case][graphite-series-380t] that is my favourite shade of yellow, but I haven't found the time to set it up since moving. Colour is important to me, and I often have to be dissuaded from getting low-quality peripherals like a mouse in the shape of a turtle. I just wish hardware was more playful!

I have a collection of notebooks that I keep at my desk, because I tend to write things down throughout the day. I like to use them in a "least pretty to most pretty" order, so it's going to be years until I get to anything gilded or leatherbound. Right now I'm writing with a Hobonichi Techo 2018 ballpoint pen; it came with a pair of meal decider dice, which was what I really wanted. I'm a sucker for novelty dice with words or symbols on them.

### And what software?

I use [Google Drive][google-drive] for almost all my work; I love being able to pull up a document on any device. Sometimes I'll find myself taking notes in the bath because it's just so easy. In the past, I've used [Notepad++][notepad-plusplus] for directly manipulating the text files in a game. I have a misplaced adoration for this simple source code editor that I can't quite explain.

In collaborative scenarios, we create online whiteboards using [Miro][]. They're perfect for exploring visual ideas, like a mood board for a certain character, or photo references for an in-game location. You can see other users dragging objects around in real-time, so recently a colleague of mine pasted sword cliparts into one of our boards, for virtual swordfighting purposes.

When I'm writing interactive fiction or prototyping a narrative feature, I typically use [Twine][]. It's a hypertext-based game engine that is very accessible, and very popular among narrative designers. It lets anyone with zero coding experience write a CYOA-style story, but can also be adapted for more ambitious projects by bringing other programming languages into the mix. I've also used free software like [Bitsy][], [Ren'Py][renpy], or the scripting language [ink][].

I listen to podcasts via [Overcast][overcast-ios] every single day, and use [Trello][] to keep myself organized. I switch the background to something representative of my dreams, like a [cabin in the mountains](https://unsplash.com/photos/hUUIPXXMTeM "A photo of a cabin in the mountains, on Unsplash."), so I'm always focused on the bigger picture and what I want to achieve in the long-term.

### What would be your dream setup?

Besides the cabin in the mountains, my dream setup involves a comfy chair and [an obnoxious custom-made desk like Danielle Steel's](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/danielle-steels-desk-is-unlike-anything-youve-ever-see "A Vanity Fair article about Danielle Steel's desk.").
