### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Miriam Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/ "Miriam's website."), and I make (mostly collaborative) things. I like working with creative teams. Around these (online) parts, I'm mostly making things with HTML and CSS. 20 years ago my theater needed a website, so I learned to make websites. Then another for my band, and it snowballed to become [OddBird](https://www.oddbird.net/ "Miriam's web ageny.") – a small web agency that's been doing some pretty big client and open-source projects.

That's a fun team to build with, but I still have my arts career running in parallel – a theater company called [Grapefruit Lab](https://grapefruitlab.com/ "Miriam's theatre company."), a band called [Teacup Gorilla](https://www.teacupgorilla.com/ "Miriam's band."), a novel called [_Riding SideSaddle_](https://read.ridingsidesaddle.com/ "Miriam's novel."), and a new album coming soon. I've been fortunate to build a life around my curiosity for different media, tinkering, and story telling.

### What hardware do you use?

I just got a Reverend Wattplower short-scale bass, which I'm enjoying. I play that through a GK amp most of the time.

All my writing and coding happens on a [16" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. At home, I run that through a [CalDigit TS3 Plus dock][ts3-plus] into two external monitors (I couldn't tell you what brands, whatever was reasonably priced and recommended). To help my old wrists, I got a [ZSA Moonlander keyboard][moonlander] and switch between a [Logitech MX Master 3][mx-master-3] and [MX Vertical mouse][mx-vertical]. I stand at my desk. Anything that's the right height and has enough space – I have no loyalty to the surface.

When I'm recording videos or running workshops, I sometimes add an [Elgato Prompter][prompter], [Logitech Brio webcam][brio] (meh), [Audio-Technica AT4040 condenser microphone][at4040] through a [Scarlett Solo interface][scarlett-solo], and a couple [FotodioX FlapJack soft LED lights][flapjack]. Why are the power cables so short on these lights? On the road, I use the [Anker 727 Charging Station][727-charging-station], a [Roost laptop stand][roost], and the [Logitech Spotlight][spotlight.3] for presenting. Basically everything there comes from other people's recommendations. I don't know how they compare to alternatives. 

All told, it's more than I need. But each tool came at a particular time, for a specific job, and the pile has slowly built up over the years.

### And what software?

Mostly [VS Code][visual-studio-code] and [iTerm2][] for coding. I've started using [Vivaldi][] as my primary browser, because I like to customize everything – and I didn't like where [Arc][arc.2] was headed. But I spend a lot of time in the Mozilla dev tools. How are they still the only ones with good flexbox and webfont inspectors? I've been using [the Alfred launcher][alfred] for years. I know there are more popular options now, but I haven't seen any reason to switch. [1Password][], [Bartender][], probably a few other utilities.

I use [Notion Calendar][notion-calendar] (née Cron) but I'm skeptical. I want something with a year view. I recently switched to [Obsidian][] for organizing my personal life, and that's working well. We use [Slack][] at OddBird, and [Coda][] for Grapefruit Lab. Files are all on [Dropbox][]. When I do graphic design, I'm most familiar with [the Adobe suite][creative-suite] – but I'm learning my way around [Figma][]. This paragraph gives me anxiety. Obsidian is the only tool I'm not renting. The rest can be ripped away from me, or destroyed by VCs, and I have to start from scratch. I hate modern software.

I run a [Mastodon][] server, using [Masto.host][]. At OddBird, the tool stack depends on the project. But most of my personal sites are built with [Eleventy][], because it's flexible and doesn't generate any output that I didn't ask for. I use [Sass][] for the same reasons. I don't like when my build tools generate code that I don't understand. I'm on my third or fourth iteration of self-built web-based presentation software – now using web components! HTML and CSS do what I need in a way that [PowerPoint][] & [Keynote][] will never understand. The web is pretty cool.

I don't like any of the writing apps I've tried (most of them). Word processors are too much, [Scrivener][] is even more, and code editors are too little. Everything specialized is too nerdy when I'm collaborating on a script. [iA Writer][ia-writer] is pretty, but I can't teach every new collaborator how to use [Markdown][]. When it comes to collaboration, the choice is between real-time editing (awful) or sending files back and forth (worse). There should be better options.

To create a light plot, I recently discovered [Drafty][]. That worked pretty well for me. I've been doing a lot of CAD in [Fusion 360][fusion-360] – designing a mechanical clock from scratch. That's also required [LightBurn][] and [PrusaSlicer][]. I joined the local maker space for access to tools.

### What would be your dream setup?

1. A real good collaborative text editor for non-technical/creative writing.
2. A full maker space within walking distance (I can walk to the pottery studio, so that's a good start)
3. Let's go all in: good public transit, and a walkable city.
4. Can I walk to the theater too?
5. A universal basic income, so we're not all wasting our labor on one capitalist hype cycle after another.

That ought to cover it. I don't need more hardware.
