### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Nathan Hoad](https://nathanhoad.net/ "Nathan's website.") and I'm an interactive developer and artist. I work on the Story Lab team at ABC News as well as doing various [creative](https://nathanhoad.itch.io/the-definitely-ending-story "Nathan and Lilly's point-and-click puzzle game.") [stuff](https://nathanhoad.itch.io/pixel-beach "Nathan and Lilly's surfing game.") with [Lilly Piri](https://lillypiri.com/ "Lilly's website.").

I like to always be learning something interesting and my current challenge is to start an indie game studio. I've been writing a game engine and have a couple of games in the works (we've competed in and occasionally won a few hackathons in the past).

A couple of years ago I did one of those 365 projects where I challenged myself to complete a painting each day, every day. [I learnt a lot from the experience](https://nathanhoad.net/what-i-learned-from-365-paintings/ "Nathan's post about his 365 paintings challenge.").

It was around that time that some friends and I started playing Dungeons & Dragons. D&D ended up featuring quite heavily in my paintings and our party's adventures continue to be a source of inspiration and creativity to this day.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a 15" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] with a [Gavin Belson Signature Edition Box 3 eGPU](https://benhoad.net/hooli-signature-edition-box-3-mod "Ben Hoad's custom built eGPU.") attached (custom built by Ben Hoad). The desk in my office at home is made from a bunch of parts from IKEA.

My Bose [QC35 headphones][quietcomfort-35] help me focus.

I enjoy composing music (mostly game stuff) and have an M-Audio [KeyStudio][] to help with that. It might not have many features but its simplicity is what I like most about it.

When I paint I use a Windsor & Newton pocket watercolour set.

I love to play games on my Nintendo [Switch][switch.2]. That thing really is the perfect console AND portable gaming machine.

My [iPhone 6S][iphone-6s] is getting quite old now but I'm not overly interested in phones so I'll probably only replace this if it gets abandoned by iOS or if I break it.

### And what software?

When I'm working on games I spend most of my time in [Visual Studio][visual-studio] and [Aseprite][]. Visual Studio for the coding and Aseprite because I use mostly pixel art in my games and Aseprite is the best and most fun editor there is. The game engine I'm working on is built on top of the [MonoGame][] framework.

I write my game music using [LMMS][]. I used to use [GarageBand][] but now that I find myself in Windows more often than [macOS][] I needed something that would work in both (and, to be honest, I actually feel like I'm more productive in LMMS even though it's harder to use).

It is for the same reason that I use [Inkscape][] for any vector graphics stuff (though I do still use [Sketch][] at lot at the ABC).

I used to use [Final Cut Pro][final-cut-pro] and [Motion][] to cut together videos but I've recently started using [DaVinci Resolve][davinci-resolve] and, while there is a new learning curve to get up to speed, it's been fun and meets my need for it to run on both Windows and macOS.

When I'm working on web stuff I use [VS Code][visual-studio-code]. While I do use [Chrome][] occasionally (it currently has a better debugger) my main browser of choice is [Firefox][]. I use [LastPass][] for all of my passwords and [Notion][] for all of my note taking.

I've been having a great time learning German in [Duolingo][duolingo-ios].

My favourite games to play at the moment are [Zelda: Breath of the Wild][the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild], [Celeste][], and [Final Fantasy IX][final-fantasy-ix] (which I've now bought on two separate release days almost 20 years apart).

### What would be your dream setup?

I kind of already have my dream setup (except maybe with the inclusion of a [Surface Studio 2][surface-studio-2] for no other reason than they look interesting). I mostly prefer doing over having so I end up just using whatever is available to get stuff done.
