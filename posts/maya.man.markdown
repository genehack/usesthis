### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm an artist, technologist, and dancer. I spend most of my time [making things](https://www.instagram.com/mayamakingthings/ "Maya's Instagram account showing things she's made.") that exist at the intersection of those worlds, dancing in [studios](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgAQEbAwKn/ "Maya's Instagram video of her dancing in a studio.") and [public spaces](https://www.instagram.com/p/Brl1ro5AQpX/ "Maya's Instagram video of her dancing in a subway."), and maintaining my love/hate relationship with the internet (mostly love though). I live online [here](http://mayaontheinter.net "Maya's website."), come visit!

### What hardware do you use?

I use a 15-inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. At home I have a [Google Home Mini][google-home-mini] that I ask about words I come across when I'm reading that I don't know or to play me the latest episode of [_The Daily_](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily "A news podcast from the New York Times."). When I go out into the world, I am always carrying whatever book I am reading (right now, it's _Ninth Street Women_) along with a [pen][207-gel-pen], my water bottle, my iPhone, and probably my [backpack][sormonne] because probably also my laptop. 

### And what software?

- [VSCode][visual-studio-code] for coding
- [Chrome][] for browsing
- [Glance Back][glance-back] for getting daily, unflattering photos of myself
- [Google Slides][google-slides] for talks/workshops/presentations/pitches
- [Paste to Download][paste-to-download] for downloading things from Slides
- [Google Drawings][google-drawings] for simple design exercises (I AM INTIMIDATED by Adobe lol)
- [Google Docs][google-docs] for writing things down
- [GBoard][gboard-ios] for quick typing
- Adobe [Creative Cloud][creative-cloud] when necessary ([Premiere][], [After Effects][after-effects], [Illustrator][], mostly)
- [Goodreads][] to keep track of my reading habits
- [Things][] for that good feeling of checking off todos
- [p5.js][] web editor for teaching beginner workshops
- [Are.na][] for moodboarding type efforts
- [Wilson][wilson-fm-ios] to find new podcasts I wouldn't come across otherwise
- Myself for dancing

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream set up would be one that allows me to focus enough to have less than 47 tabs open at one time, but I'm still dreaming.
