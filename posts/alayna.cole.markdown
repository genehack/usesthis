### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Alayna](http://alaynamcole.com/ "Alayna's website."), and I do a lot of things! I work full-time as a producer in the games industry, but I'm also managing director of a charity, and I do a lot of research and publication. I have two books coming out next year!

### What hardware do you use?

Right now, I am typing this on the PC that I took from my desk at Defiant Development, after our studio sadly closed a few weeks ago, so honestly I have no idea what is inside this machine. According to my System window, I have an Intel [i5-4690][core-i5-4690] CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and an AMD [Radeon R9 200][radeon-r9-200] series graphics card. I haven't even removed Defiant's administrative lock on the PC yet!

As for other hardware, I'm rocking a fancy new pair of Audio-Technica [ATH-M50x][] noise cancelling headphones, and a basic Microsoft corded mouse and keyboard. Nothing special!

I also use an ASUS F402W Notebook PC when I'm travelling (which is often) and some brandless bluetooth headphones that I bought from a knock-off store online. My phone's an [iPhone SE][iphone-se] with a cracked screen, which is next on my list of hardware I need to replace.

### And what software?

I've recently become fully dependent on the cloud, so I'm living on [Google's suite][g-suite] of products. I use [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Google Sheets][google-sheets] most, and have [Gmail][], [Google Drive][google-drive], and [Google Calendars][google-calendar] open all the time. I sound like a walking advertisement for the company!

I do a lot of quick image edits, and have always leaned on [PhotoFiltre 7][photofiltre] for that, so I don't have to open [Photoshop][] every time I just need to crop or colour change an image. I also use [Slack][] and [Discord][] to keep in touch with my teams, and [Trello][] for personal task tracking. I love [Hootsuite][] for easy social media updating, which is important to spread the word about the charity work I'm doing.

### What would be your dream setup?

You can tell from how little I knew about my PC before answering these questions that I am not very fussy! So long as I have enough processing power to play some videogames (I'm addicted to [Final Fantasy XIV][final-fantasy-xiv] at the moment) and access to the Internet so I can use the Google Suite, I'm content! So I guess I'm living my dream already.
