### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Byron Dyce II, a gym owner ([Bluprint Fitness](https://bluprintfit.com/ "A gym in Chicago.")) and strength & conditioning coach by trade. We help busy professionals create a socially connected & healthy lifestyle without giving up their favorite activities. We do this by following proven fitness systems and housing a network of hard working individuals who genuinely enjoy working out together. We strive to show everyday people how badass the human body is.

### What hardware do you use?

Personally, I use a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (13-inch, 2019, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports). 

- Processor: 1.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5
- Memory: 8 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3
- Graphics: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 645 1536 MB

In the gym, we use a [Chromebox][] linked to two TVs with shared screens to stream videos and host the gym software. We also use an iPad linked to speakers for gym music.

### And what software?

For marketing purposes, we use [Photoshop][] and [Canva][] to create content that aligns with our message.

For back end business analysis, we primarily use [Google Drive][google-drive] to house all things and [Google Sheets][google-sheets] (we are spreadsheet nerds) to create "check-lists" within the business.

In the gym, we use [Wodify][], gym management software that allows us to consolidate everything from results tracking to point of sale functions.

### What would be your dream setup?

As a person who values time more than anything, I'm always looking for ways to streamline business systems on the backend and always have snapshot of business health. My ideal set-up would be to have a platform that houses all of the following:

- Gym Management (memberships, workout tracking, payroll, and point of sale)
- Marketing (scheduled posts across multiple platforms)
- Lead Management (automated lead follow-up systems and tracking)
- Financial Analysis (revenue/expense tracking, trends, and breakdown)

Having all of the above in one place would not only make work more efficient (freeing up time), it would allow me to get a faster snapshot of business health at any given time.
