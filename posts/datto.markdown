### Who are you, and what do you do?

I go by [Datto](https://www.youtube.com/user/DattoDoesDestiny "Datto's YouTube account.") online and I'm a YouTuber and livestreamer. My content is based on the game [Destiny 2][destiny-2], where I mainly do PvE tutorials and guides, while also doing commentary on the game as a whole.

### What hardware do you use?

My current rig is a build from March 2016 that I built, an [i7-6700k][core-i7-6700k], an ASUS [Z170-PRO][] motherboard, with 32GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR4-2666 RAM, a [GTX 1080 Ti][geforce-gtx-1080-ti] and a 1000 W Corsair Fully Modular power supply. I also have about 25TB worth of Seagate external hard drives for storage (I like to archive EVERYTHING), with a Samsung 850 Pro Series SSD and an external Samsung SSD (1TB all combined).

### And what software?

Well, I guess Destiny 2 the game counts as software, but for the most part, I use [OBS][obs-studio] (Open Broadcaster Software), Adobe [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro], [Audition][] and [Media Encoder][media-encoder]. I used to be on [Final Cut 7][final-cut-pro] back when that was actually a thing, although I'm now realizing that FCP7 was almost a decade ago. I moved to Premiere Pro after I stopped using Mac, also quite a long time ago. I used to use [Audacity][], the free software for audio, but I ended up having some weird issues with it, so I moved to Audition. OBS is what I use to stream.

### What would be your dream setup?

The dream setup would probably start with a bigger desk so I have more room. Otherwise, I'm just looking for the best of the best stuff. A [2080 Ti][geforce-rtx-2080-ti], 2 TB of NVMe storage, lots of USB 3.0/3.1/Type-C ports on a motherboard. [i9-9900k][core-i9-9900k] or even one of the more extreme ones like the [9980XE][core-i9-9980xe] for video editing, even though it seems like overkill. I'd love to get one of those wall-mounted PCs custom built too, or even one built into the desk. I know future-proofing is impossible, but I'd like to get as close to that as I can.
