### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Molly Mary O'Brien](http://mollymaryobrien.com/ "Molly's website."), a video producer and writer living in Brooklyn, NY. My full-time job is making videos for the health and wellness site Well+Good, but in my spare time I am always experimenting with making other video things. Documenting and sharing peoples' creative processes in video form is very satisfying to me; [here's a short profile I made](https://vimeo.com/257487850/ "Molly's interview with Bianca Ng on Vimeo.") about visual storyteller Bianca Ng for a series I started called _people making cool things_. I'm also getting more into shooting performance-based stuff like music, dance and comedy. When I REALLY have extra brain space, I enjoy [writing fiction](http://mollymaryobrien.com/fiction/ "Molly's writing."). I like experimenting with formats and trying weird visual things — [this is a short story I wrote in the form of a music festival poster](https://twitter.com/missmollymary/status/819941000000995328 "Molly's short story/music festival poster tweet.").

I also co-host a biweekly podcast with my boyfriend Chris Wade called [And Introducing](http://soundcloud.com/and-intro-pod "Molly and Chris' podcast."), which is about "words about music," aka musician memoirs and biographies, criticism, interviews, and less-classifiable mediums ([here's an episode we did with Hillary Benton](https://soundcloud.com/and-intro-pod/28-the-lordeantonoff-conspiracy-ft-hillary-benton "An episode of Molly's podcast with Hillary Benton.") about her investigative [PowerPoint presentation](https://twitter.com/buzzkillary/status/987104349351501825 "Hillary Benton's tweet about her Lorde PowerPoint presentation.") about the hidden meaning of Lorde's album _Melodrama_). I do the pre-production and Chris engineers and edits each episode (and also composes the theme music for each).

### What hardware do you use?

My computer is a 13" 2015 [MacBook Air][macbook-air] which is fine for cutting simple social videos but starts wheezing when I try to do anything with 4k footage. I only got into shooting + editing video last year and this machine needs an upgrade badly!

My camera is a [Panasonic GH4][lumix-dmc-gh4] (great for beginners). I have a [Rode VideoMic Go shotgun mic][videomic-go], a very cheap Amazon Basics tripod, and the LimoStudio softbox light kit, which is nice cost-effective lighting to have on hand. I also just got a [Canon VIXIA R800 camcorder][vixia-hf-r800] that I'm kind of obsessed with. I was weirdly inspired by Kylie Jenner's [birth announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhIEIO0vaBE "Kylie Jenner's birth announcement video on YouTube."), some of which was shot with camcorders; it had a warmth and intimacy that I found fascinating, so I [wanted to start making stuff with one](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/camcorderlyfe/ "Instagram posts tagged with 'camcorderlyfe.'").

I usually am several models of iPhone behind the current one and was rocking an [iPhone 6][iphone-6] til this past April when I lost it at a mosh pit at Coachella — so I decided to treat myself to the [8+][iphone-8-plus] in all its Portrait Mode glory. I had to get [Jabra Move Bluetooth headphones][move.2] to accommodate the 8+ because keeping track of that Lightning-to-3.5mm dongle suuuucks so wireless headphones it is. I use the Wirecutter for lots of my gear recommendations and they suggested the Jabras as an affordable option. 

### And what software?

I edit on [Adobe Premiere Pro][premiere-pro]. I write most things, including podcast notes and fiction, on [Google Docs][google-docs], though I'm always on a futile search for The Perfect Minimal Word Processor. I use [Gmail][] and [Slack][] for work-related communication and dig [Celtx][] for writing scripts. On my phone I use [Instagram][instagram-ios] all the dang time, the [Kindle app][kindle-ios] for reading library books on my phone, the [TeuxDeux app][teuxdeux-ios] (which is just my dream to-do list functionality, shoutout to Tina Roth Eisenberg for making that particular jam), [Nike Training Club][nike-training-club-ios] for workouts, and [HUJI Cam][huji-cam-ios] for taking trendy-ass disposable camera looking pics (their tagline is "just like the year 1998"). I purposefully keep the [Facebook][facebook-ios] and [Twitter][twitter-ios] apps *off* my phone, and I do this thing where I put all my apps in one folder on the 2nd page of the homescreen so as to keep mindless app-tapping to a minimum. I learned this tactic, no joke, from googling "marie kondo your phone" and I actually love it.

Oh! I am very into the [Golden Thread Tarot app][golden-thread-tarot-ios]. So well-designed, great for anyone who wants to dabble in the decks.

### What would be your dream setup?

I think I've got it pretty good, and have been blessed with having enough money to acquire the gear to help further my creative pursuits. I am definitely eyeing a nicer desktop setup, like a 27" [iMac][], so I'm not constantly murdering my comp with high-res footage, and I'd love to eventually own some lav mics for documentary stuff. Other than that, just more hours in the day would be a nice setup.
