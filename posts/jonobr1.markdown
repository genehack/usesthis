### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Jono](https://jonobr1.com/ "Jono's website.") and I'm finishing up my MFA in New Media at Paris College of Art. I mix graphic design and computer programming to connect and question things. As such I often pair distinct subjects to frame this creative process. The combinations range from [latin and emojis](https://lost-and-found.gifts/ "Jono's latin and emoji book project.") through [typography and animation](http://www.anitype.com/ "Jono's animated typography project.") to [music and image][patatap]. While pairings vary, there is always a consistent and accessible tenor to the digital and physical objects I make. This focus allows people to access complex subject matters including [painting theory](https://expressing-kandinsky.net/ "Jono's explorations of Kandinsky's artwork."), the [collision of black holes](https://works.jonobr1.com/LESI "Jono's black hole-inspired audio project."), and [music composition](https://works.jonobr1.com/Typatone "Jono's typing audio project."). Jono’s work offers considered respite from the fatigue of the attention economy.

My work has been shown at international festivals including TED, Sundance, Tribeca Film Festival, SIGGRAPH, and the Japan Media Arts Festival. I spoke on [The Responsibility in Democratization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzGtJnhOSFg "A YouTube video of Jono's talk at Gray Area Festival.") at San Francisco’s first creative coding conference, the Gray Area Festival, and about [The Human Side to Being a Digital Practitioner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOfEMWV_5Rc "A YouTube video of Jono's talk about OpenVis.") at OpenVis Conference. My commitment to Visual Music has sparked collaborations with musicians including applications with Lullatone, a performance with Nosaj Thing, and interactive music videos for [the Arcade Fire](https://www.justareflektor.com "The Arcade Fire's interactive music video for 'Just A Reflektor.'") and [Matthew Dear](https://www.with.in/watch/what-you-dont-know/ "An interactive music video for Matthew Dear's song 'What You Don't Know.'").

### What hardware do you use?

The hardware I use the most are my 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], an Asus 3 button mouse, USB-C wired headphones, my Leuchtturm softcover sketchbook, [MUJI pen][hexagonal-aluminum-ball-point-pen-0.7mm], and my Claska workers apron which keeps me in a productive mindset. I have high blood pressure, so I also carry an [Omron cuff][3-series-wrist]. Recently I've been using the Oculus [Quest][] to develop Virtual Reality experiences, like the one for Matthew Dear. For live performances, I use a ROLI [Seaboard Block Studio Edition][seaboard-block-studio-edition]. For inspiration and messing around I look to my 11" [iPad Pro][ipad-pro], Nintendo [Switch][switch.2], and [OP-Z][op-z]. For transport, I ride a 17/43 Mash x Cinelli steel fixed gear bike. In a similar vein to [John Maeda's email list](https://design.co/signup/ "John Maeda's CX newsletter."), one non-tech item I'm a huge fan of are curaprox's manual toothbrushes — can't argue with Swiss design.

### And what software?

To develop my projects I write a lot of custom software. Since undergraduate studies at UCLA’s Design Media Arts, I have and continue to actively participate in open source communities. I share my own libraries, such as the event driven two-dimensional drawing interface for the web [Two.js][], on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonobr1/ "Jono's GitHub account."). I'm also an investing backer in [Arena][are.na]. I love tinkering and messing around in professional software environments as well. [Atom][] text editor and Adobe [CC][creative-cloud] is my second home and I'm getting my feet wet with [Cinema 4D][cinema-4d], [Rhino][], and [Blender][]. When working with sounds I also find myself relying on [Ableton][live] quite a bit.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream space would bring me the feeling of cooking in the kitchen when I'm working on my computer. The apron is a small gesture towards that...
