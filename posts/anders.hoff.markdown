### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm an [artist](https://inconvergent.net/ "Anders' website.") who works with code, ink and paper. When I'm not making art, I work as a Software Engineer. Sometimes I do things related to Machine Learning.

It wasn't really my intention to become a programmer - or an artist - when I started studying mathematics (and physics) at Uni. I ended up taking a greater liking to the programming part than the mathematics, and here we are.

### What hardware do you use?

My main workhorse is a desktop computer that I built some time ago. The goal was a combination of silence and performance. Highlights include a sound dampened tower (Fractal Design [Define S][define-s], a surprisingly silent graphics card (MSI [GeForce GTX 1080][geforce-gtx-1080] Gaming X), an i7 processor, 32 GBs of RAM, and a 512 GB M.2 disk. At the moment I have a 30" Lenovo ([LT3053p][thinkvision-lt3053p]) monitor, which I'm very happy with. After trying an embarrassingly large number of keyboards, I'm currently using a Kinesis Gaming [Freestyle Edge][freestyle-edge] keyboard with a lift kit. Next to it is a Logitech [MX Anywhere 2][mx-anywhere-2].

Music needs are covered by a Cambridge Audio [DacMagic Plus][dacmagic-plus], and a pair of old Grado [SR125s][sr125e].

I have two EMSL Axidraws. An [older A4 version][axidraw-v3], and a [V3/A3][axidraw-v3-a3]. The Axidraws are excellent machines, and I can recommend them to anyone who wants to experiment with drawing machines.

Recently I also bought a 17" inkjet printer (Epson [SC P800][surecolor-p800]). Still in the process of working out how to get the results I want from it.

### And what software?

My computer has dual boot with [Windows 10][windows-10] (out of necessity), and [Ubuntu][]. Most of the time I don't need to start Windows at all. In Ubuntu I run [AwesomeWM][awesome], and I pretty much live in the [GNOME terminal][gnome-terminal].

For programming, I use a mixture of Common Lisp ([SBCL][]), [Python][], and some [JavaScript][]. The past few years I've been using Lisp almost exclusively when making art. It started as an experiment, where I wanted to learn something new. I ended up liking it quite a lot, and I've been using it since.

For version control I use [Git][], and I edit and write code in [Neovim][]. Mostly stumbled into vim by accident, but now I can't use anything else.

I find Python very useful for making small utilities and tools. As an example [here is a tool](https://github.com/inconvergent/fn "Anders' filename tool on GitHub.") that makes file names based on the time and current git revision. And [here is a tool](https://github.com/inconvergent/svgsort "Anders' tool on GitHub for creating plottable SVG files.") for creating SVG files that can be plotted efficiently.

For quick image editing I use either [Inkscape][] or [GIMP][]. I also use [Photoshop][] from time to time. Particularly when editing larger files, or when preparing for print.

### What would be your dream setup?

I am fortunate enough to essentially have all the equipment and space I strictly speaking need. It would be amazing to have my own dedicated studio space, but my dream setup is more to do with time than space: I don't know what would happen if I suddenly had the opportunity to spend all my time and energy on art. I'd like to find out.
