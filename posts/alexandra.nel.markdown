### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Alexandra Nel](https://www.alexandranel.com/ "Alexandra's website."), and I'm a motion graphics designer based in Melbourne, Aus.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a PC! Built by Smoosh Workstations in Brunswick. 

Processor: [AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT][ryzen-9-3900xt].
Graphics Card: [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070][geforce-rtx-3070].

I have things split across 3 drives:

- C drive (SSD), which predominantly runs my programs.
- D drive (SSD), where I keep all of my working project files.
- E drive, which isn't an SSD, and is used to archive and library all the files I am not using (more space less power).

Peripherals: 
[Wacom Cintiq][cintiq], [Logitec Z533 2.1 surround multimedia speakers][z533], Dell wide-screen monitor, Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard.

### And what software?

I use the Adobe Suite - [PSD][photoshop], [AI][illustrator], [After Effects][after-effects], [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro] and the odd [InDesign][]. I have also come across [Lottie][], [Slack][], [SketchUp][], [Blender][], [C4D][cinema-4d], and would love to get into [Unity][]. I require [Xero][] for accounting, but am looking into Henry now for freelancers. I use [Google Drive][google-drive] and [Gmail][] heeeeaps - this is how I move assets and outputs around for my clients SquareSpace for website (not so much a software but kinda essential)

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love more space and more processing power on my computer. I think eventually I'll just need more power, and I'll have two desktops linked up to each other for rendering. It'd be cool to have all the latest graphics cards ie. [GeForce RTX 3090][geforce-rtx-3090], huge disk drives with heaps of speed etc etc.

MORE SCREENS that are WALL MOUNTED!

But at the moment for what I do I'm okay, I can work smarter rather than keep boosting my tech, which is a good way to get to know my computer a bit better also! 

The cool thing about a Smoosh Workstation is that you can just call John and have him stack a few more components in the existing box. I love PCs for this - you get so much more bang for your buck! And you can build it WITH the business. Smoosh Workstations have done so much for me in the way of educating me about my needs and the application of products etc.

I love my Wacom Cintiq, but I have actually found it to be kind of glitchy. I had to send it back for a replacement at one point, and they were really great at assisting me with this. However, it does (sporadically and unexplainably) just disconnect itself and require a hard reset. It would be nice to have a floating piece of tech like a tablet that I could do more illustration and admin work on outside of the office. I definitely think a tablet or [Surface Pro][surface-pro], or something that I can link with my PC and work on outside of the office would be very beneficial.
