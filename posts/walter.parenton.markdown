### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! My name is [Walter](https://twitter.com/GoodBoyGraphics "Walter's Twitter acount."), and I am a video editor at Funimation by day, and an illustrator for the internet at night. I work in the Promotional Video Department at Funimation, where we make the trailers and commercials for the anime we license from Japan, such as Dragon Ball Z and One Piece. In my free time I illustrate, from mobile apps to editorial and clothing brands.

### What hardware do you use?

A few years back my [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] died, along with my external HD, losing everything, so I decided it was a good time to reset and minimize. I bought a new 2015 MacBook Pro, and a [Magic Mouse][magic-mouse], all of which I am still playing on. I decided to take illustrating seriously, find my style, and start posting work non-stop!

But before I really got into illustrating on the computer, I went through a long journey buying every pen and marker that ever existed, hoping to find the one pen to rule them all and make me a good artist.  

After experimenting with all kinds of styles, with all kinds of pens, on all kinds of paper, I came to the conclusion that such a magical tool does not exist. I was also tired of all the steps - sketch, ink, scan, color - so it was then that I decided cut the steps down and just go fully digital. But hey, that's the process, and it's evolved quite a bit over the past 5 years, even as of today!  

I do carry one notebook and one pen to draft ideas with. Right now, I am currently using a Montana Acrylic Paint Marker, which mimics how I illustrate on the computer - thick and bold!

### And what software?

For software, I nearly use the entire [Adobe Creative Suite][creative-suite]! [Premiere][] for editing, [Photoshop][] and [Illustrator][] for illustration, and [After Effects][after-effects] for motion graphics. Oh, and [Adobe Media Encoder][media-encoder] to encode videos for online.

[Google Drive][google-drive] to upload my work, so I can then download it to my phone and post. [Google Keep][google-keep] to make mental notes and pin references.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be having my studio at The Philip Johnson Glass House. Surrounded by lots of natural light, greenery and quietness.
