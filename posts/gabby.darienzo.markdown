### Who are you, and what do you do?

I’m [Gabby](https://gabbydarienzo.com/ "Gabby's website."), a video game developer and multidisciplinary artist who specializes in creating stylized 2D/3D artwork for games.

I’m best-known as the creator of [A Mortician’s Tale][a-morticians-tale] and worked as an artist on indies like [Celeste][], [Parkitect][], and [Super Crush KO][super-crush-ko] among many others.

By day I work at [Drinkbox Studios](https://www.drinkboxstudios.com/ "A video game studio.") as a senior game artist-- most recently on [Nobody Saves the World][nobody-saves-the-world] and currently on a _new, unannounced project_. By night I work on my own small indie games, illustrations, and over the past year have gotten into tattooing as a hobby.

### What hardware do you use?

At Drinkbox’s office I use a Windows PC and a [Wacom Cintiq Pro 24][cintiq-pro] with a random mechanical keyboard, mouse, and headset I found around the office.

At home I use Windows PC and a [Wacom Intuos Drawing Tablet][intuos] with a much more aesthetic mouse and keyboard setup:

- Keyboard: [Pink Filco Majestouch 2][majestouch-2] with [Astrolokeys][] key caps
- Mouse: [Quartz Pink Razer Lancehead Tournament Edition][lancehead-tournament-edition]
- Controller: [Xbox PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller][powera-enhanced] in “Pink Lemonade”
- Headphones: Pink DEEBOX
- Palm-Rest: Aurora Collection TKL Keyboard Palm Rest

I slowly built this setup over the pandemic and my desk has subsequently become a much more inviting space for personal work and playing games with friends.

For illustrations and tattoo designs I use a 2014 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] and [iPad][] (6th Gen) with an [Apple Pencil][pencil]. I love having the ability to use them away from a desk and work at my couch, kitchen table, or even take them to a cafe.

For tattooing I use a [Dragonhawk Rotary Pen][wq090-16], ATOMUS Cartridge Needles, Dynamic Colour Co inks, and an [Itari Thermal Printer][m08f] for stencils. I would love to buy a fancier tattoo machine one day, but I’m still pretty new at it and wanted to start with something more affordable.

### And what software?

At Drinkbox we use our own proprietary game engine, [Photoshop][], [Illustrator][], and [Blender][] for art, [Discord][] for team chat, [TortoiseSVN][] for version control, [Google Docs][google-docs] for documentation, and [Bugzilla][] for managing bugs.

For my personal games I use [Unity][], Photoshop, Blender, [ZBrush][], and [Substance Painter][substance-painter]. I use [Trello][] for project management, Google Docs for documentation, and [Pinterest][] for gathering inspiration and creating visual development boards.

For illustrations and tattoo designs I use [Procreate][procreate-ios].

### What would be your dream setup?

Honestly, I would just like more space.

Right now I live in a cozy one-bedroom attic apartment with my cat. I’d love to have a secondary room that I could use as an office, with a larger desk with space for a Cintiq, and a dedicated spot for tattooing.

Toronto rent/housing is absurdly expensive though, so this may end up being a literal _dream_.
