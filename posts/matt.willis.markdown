### Who are you, and what do you do?

Matt Willis - I run [yelldesign](https://www.yelldesign.com/ "Matt's studio website."), a short-form content studio (internet videos) that was created as result of various experiments with stop motion on [Vine][vine-ios] around 7 years ago. Yelldesign has 5 employees and we do mostly quirky, bright, colourful and clean stop motion films. We use lots of paper because we have this [laser cutter][speedy-100] and [paperme](https://www.yelldesign.com/our-work/#paper "Examples of yelldesign's paper animations.") looks nice on camera. We also love food and do lots of [food videos](https://www.yelldesign.com/our-work/#food "Examples of yelldesign's food videos.") - it also looks nice and has obvious universal appeal.

### What hardware do you use?

Pre-production:

- Trotec Speedy 100 laser cutter.
- A battery operated sharpener which is intensely satisfying to use.
- Swann-Morton retractable scalpels with 10A blades. 
- Mundial 10cm embroidery scissors. They are extremely good quality and the perfect size for papercraft.
- Bosistos Eucalyptus spray to clean everything ‚Äì particularly scalpels, scissors and cutting mats. Nothing beats the smell of eucalyptus in the morning.
- A MOUNTAIN of [Blu-Tack][].
- And endless rolls of double-sided tape. We couldn't do our work without it.

Production:

- 2017 [iMac][] with loads RAM.
- [iPad Pro][ipad-pro]  12.9" (first gen) - although I still can't find enough uses for it in my current workflow.
- Canon [5D III][eos-5d-mark-iii] with a Canon [60D][eos-60d] back-up camera.
- Canon [50mm prime lens][ef-50mm-f1.8-stm] üòç clearest, cheapest and amazingest lens for stills.
- Canon [24-70mm L Series zoom lens][ef-24-70mm-f2.8l-ii-usm]. A workhorse, a beautiful allrounder for stopmotion.
- Manfrotto Table attached tripods ‚Äì when I was made aware of these I nearly fell over ‚Äì so sturdy.
- Rhinogear motorised stepped slider with arc head.

### And what software?

Creative:

[Dragonframe][] for capture and image sorting/exporting.

Then mostly an Adobe CC workflow:

- [Photoshop][] for frame by frame editing.
- [Premiere][] for compiling.
- [After Effects][after-effects] for special stuff.
- [Audition][] for sound clean-ups.

Business:

- [Slack][] to keep everyone on same page.
- [Xero][] for accounts.
- [Bear][] for notes.
- SONOS for music.

### What would be your dream setup?

- A stable shooting surface.
- [This insane Dragonframe motion control rig](https://www.dragonframe.com/blog/dragonframe-and-the-volo-motion-control-crane/ "An article about the Volo motion crane.") that no longer exists.
- ARRI [ALEXA Mini][alexa-mini].
- Sony Alpha [Œ±9 II][a9-ii].
- [Laowa 24mm Macro probe][laowa-24mm-f14-2x-macro-probe].
- Probably a fleet of [Bolt camera arms][bolt-jr] (and the knowledge to configure them.)
- LOADS of space.
- Half a dozen of the most expensive [Mac Pros][mac-pro] and about a dozen monitors.
- And a MAVAM [Espresso One Group][espress-one-group] for the team!
