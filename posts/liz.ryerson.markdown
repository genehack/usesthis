### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I'm [Liz Ryerson](https://twitter.com/ellaguro "Liz's Twitter account."). I'm a musician, writer, podcaster, and occasional artist and game designer.

### What hardware do you use?

For music, not much! Outside of my laptop and a cheap M-AUDIO USB MIDI keyboard anyway. I bought it because it has a lot of knobs on it. I have an [APC40][] but yet to use it for anything in particular. I also have a Shure [SM58][] and a 4-channel mixer I've had for a very long time hooked up to my laptop for podcasting purposes. I also have Audio Technica [ATH-M50x][] headphones that have gotten all beaten up from me taking them on the subway with me. In general I'm not a big gearhead though.

### And what software?

I've used an old version of [Reason][] for 15+ years for music and just never got out of the habit. Way back in 2002 I learned how to do stuff with [modplug][] and before that I made MIDIs in [Anvil Studio][anvil-studio]. Occasionally I'd use Reaper in the past in tandem with the old version of Reason. I have been trying to get more into [Ableton][live] but have yet to do much of anything in it. I just use [Audacity][] for the podcast. If I ever do end up streaming or video recording I mostly use [OBS][obs-studio].

### What would be your dream setup?

Something that's simple and intuitive. I probably should buy a dedicated soundcard/audio interface and some monitors in the future. That'd be nice. But like I said, I'm not a big gearhead. Plus I move around a lot so it'd be hard to hold onto anything super expensive if I did own it.
