### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Richard Deveraux](https://lowlidev.com.au/ "Richard's website.") and I like making web based tools for games. I'm probably most well known for building the interactive [Destiny 2 maps](https://lowlidev.com.au/destiny/maps/ "Richard's interactive Destiny 2 maps.") that use [Bungie's APIs](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api "The API documentation for Bungie's Destiny APIs.") to track player progression. Back during Destiny 1, I maintained the [unofficial documentation](https://destinydevs.github.io/BungieNetPlatform/ "The unofficial docs for Destiny 1's APIs.") for the Bungie APIs that helped power other really cool community apps like [DIM][] and [Ishtar Collective](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/ "A lore resource for Destiny.").

I'm also a Gearbox Community Badass for the resources I made for [Battleborn](https://lowlidev.com.au/battleborn/ "Richard's Battleborn tools.") and more recently, [Borderlands](https://lowlidev.com.au/borderlands/ "Richard's Borderlands tools.").

### What hardware do you use?

I'm currently working off of a 5+ year old [MacBook Air][macbook-air], but I'm hoping to get an upgrade soon since it's starting to struggle with the more memory intensive stuff like rendering 3D models!

### And what software?

I do the majority of my development using a text editor and the [Chrome DevTools][chrome-devtools] with [VS Code][visual-studio-code] being my current text editor of choice. I use a combination of [Photoshop][] and [Illustrator][] and the very occasional use of [Adobe Animate][animate] to adjust graphic assets for use on the web. I test my website locally using [MAMP][] and [SourceTree][] is my go to for version control. I'm also horribly addicted to [Slack][] and [Discord][] for communication and the [mobile Twitter app][twitter-ios] is almost never closed on my iPhone.

My website has been built with a combination of [PHP][], [Less][less.2] and [AngularJS][] with [Bootstrap][] for layout, but I have been looking to update my stack with other technologies such as [React][] and [Sass][].

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be a dedicated office space with large secondary monitors to ease developing for larger screens. I would also have a dedicated PC able to run Windows and for playing games. Extracting game assets currently involves loading up a virtual machine on a [Mac Mini][mac-mini] via screen share since there are specific tools I need that are not built with Mac users in mind.
