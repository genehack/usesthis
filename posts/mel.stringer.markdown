### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Mel Stringer](https://www.melstringer.com.au/ "Mel's website."), and I'm a freelance illustrator and visual artist. I'm originally from Australia, but I'm currently based on Whidbey Island, just outside Seattle. I draw a lot of cute curvy women, personal portraits and autobiographical diary comics.

I'm also trying to get back into making music again under the name Golden Puppy.

### What hardware do you use?

Currently I am in-between worlds with my [iPad][ipad-pro] 9.7" and Apple [Pencil][] and I use an Apple [iMac][] with a Wacom [Cintiq][] 22 that I just got. Two very different pieces of equipment, but I love them both! 

I also use an [iPhone 8 Plus][iphone-8-plus].

As for music, I just ordered the Zoom [H6][], so I'm excited to try that out for audio recording.

I also use a Canon [600D][eos-600d] (with a small Rode mic that can be plugged in) and a Canon [G5 X][powershot-g5-x] for photography and videography.

### And what software?

[Procreate][procreate-ios] on the iPad. Adobe [Photoshop][] and [Indesign][] on the iMac.

I also love [VSCO][vsco-ios] on the iPad/iPhone, Photoshop and [Lightroom][] for photography editing.

[Lumafusion][lumafusion-ios] and VSCO on the iPad and [Premiere][] on the iMac for video editing.

### What would be your dream setup?

This is a great, but difficult question because while I would be so happy to have a large setup with everything I could ever want, I feel like I would much rather have a more minimal setup. This would mean things are more portable and interchangeable. As long as what I have does the job well and efficiently then I am happy. 

I wouldn't mind a large scale printer for making archival art prints from the comfort of my home, but I am equally as happy paying someone else to do that for me.

At the end of the day, I think having more space to work in and be creative in is what I would like the most. I have ample space now, but realistically I have everything that I could need right at the moment.

I could always upgrade but I feel like so much can be done with what I already have.
