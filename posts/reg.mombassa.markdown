### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm an [artist and musician](https://www.facebook.com/RegMombassa "Reg's Facebook page."). I exhibit at [Watters Gallery](https://wattersgallery.com/ "An art gallery in Sydney.") in Sydney (until they close at the end of the year), and have had solo and group shows interstate and overseas. I also do freelance graphic jobs, mainly t-shirts, posters and book and CD covers. I sell prints, t-shirts and merchandise on [the SMH online store](https://www.thestore.com.au/category/artists/reg-mombassa "Reg's merchandise at The Store.").

I am a member of two bands, [Dog Trumpet](https://www.dogtrumpet.net/ "An Australian band.") and The Pinks, whose gig can be found on my Facebook page.

### What hardware do you use?

For music I use Fender and Vox amps, and play a [Fender Stratocaster][stratocaster], a Hofner electric guitar, a Dobro Resonator and a [Fender Paramount][paramount] acoustic guitar. For the art I use oil and acrylic paint and draw with charcoal, coloured pencils (Conte a Paris or Stabilos), pastels and glitter.

### And what software?

My wife Martina works as my assistant and uses a PC with [Adobe Photoshop][photoshop] and [Microsoft Office][office]. My brother Peter O'Doherty engineers and produces Dog Trumpets music at his place on a Mac computer using [Pro Tools][pro-tools] and [Universal Music Interface][universal-music-interface].

### What would be your dream setup?

I have no dream setup because my technical skills are non-existent. Basically I sit at the kitchen table with an acoustic guitar to write songs and record ideas on a cassette recorder or an [iPad][] using the [MicrophonePro app][microphone-pro-ios]. Most of the art is done sitting at a table in my studio and occasionally at an easel.
