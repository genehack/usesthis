### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I’m the editor of the “[Funny Women](https://therumpus.net/sections/blogs/funny-women-blogs/ "The 'Funny Women' column on The Rumpus.")” column on the online literary magazine [The Rumpus](https://therumpus.net/ "A literary community/magazine.") and the author of the award-deserving memoir _[Hysterical](https://www.elissabassist.com/hystericalbookthatiliterallywrote "Elissa's memoir.")_ (published by Hachette).

As a founding contributor to The Rumpus, I’ve written cultural and personal criticism since the website launched in 2009. My [writing](https://www.elissabassist.com/writing "Elissa's writing.") has appeared in _The New York Times_, _Marie Claire_, _Creative Nonfiction_, and more, including the anthology _Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture_, edited by Roxane Gay.

For 15 years I’ve worked as a freelance writer, editor, instructor, academic, performer, improviser (sorry), and critic. Now I [teach](https://www.elissabassist.com/teachingandworkshopsnotjustforbillmurray "Elissa's workshops and teaching info.") tragicomic writing at The New School, [92nd Street Y](https://www.92ny.org/class/humor-writing-bassist "Elissa's writing class at the 92nd St Y."), [Pandemic University](https://pandemicuniversity.com/tragicomic-memoir/ "Elissa's writing class at Pandemic University."), Lighthouse Writers Workshop, and elsewhere, and I am probably my therapist’s favorite.

Also, I have many, many matches on Hinge.

### What hardware do you use?

I’m the proud owner of an outdated [MacBook Air][macbook-air] that no longer updates software. Due to my aging neck, I keep it on a [Roost stand][roost] and use a wireless mouse called Jelly Comb and a wireless external keyboard called [Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue][freestyle2-mac]. (I did not name these devices.) (I did name my iPad “iPadollonia” all by myself early in the pandemic.) I use the laptop most often at home or in my office, which is also the New York subway system, where I do my best work because there’s no WiFi.

Back to my aging neck. At home I switch between my laptop and an [iMac][] with a million-inch screen that was supposed to fix my posture/body, but it hasn’t.

Recently, for online interviews to promote my book (_Hysterical_ by Elissa Bassist), I bought a UBeesize ring light (still unused) and a recommended [Samson mic][q2u] and [AirPods][]. And not to brag, but I have a printer-scanner-copied at home that works almost 80% of the time. Also! As every writer should, I have a SAD lamp for winter, when my regular depression meets seasonal depression.

### And what software?

To write, I toggle between [Microsoft Word][word] and [Scrivener][]. I will warn that Scrivener exacerbated, if not caused, my diagnosed Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

I wrote an [essay about it for Literary Hub](https://lithub.com/when-your-ocd-therapy-is-also-a-treatment-for-writers-block/ "Elissa's essay about writer's block and OCD on Literary Hub.") and will now quote myself:

> “Before you quit,” my psychopharmacologist offered, “get treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder.” For what? I didn’t have that. I had Scrivener. But the psychopharmacologist disagreed. She believed that it wasn’t Scrivener and that I didn’t have writer’s block—I had a mental illness, OCD.

The psychopharmacologist’s evidence that I’d provided: It took me 11 years to write and rewrite one book. Which, again, was actually Scrivener’s fault.

For sharing documents and for editing humor pieces and students’ work, I use [Google Docs][google-docs] and am not at peace with it.

### What would be your dream setup?

I’ve been learning how to practice gratitude, so I’ll say it’s the setup I have now: two desks in separate locations of my apartment. One is an antique desk for sitting down with my laptop. Another is a hypermodern standing desk that has a motor and charging station that I saw on [TikTok][] (it’s from Costco) for my Mac desktop that I got for free.
