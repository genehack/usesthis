### Who are you, and what do you do?

i am jes. i'm a dreamer, empath, existentialist, and lover of humanity.

i'm existential, asexual, anxious, depressed. i've always been a sad weird guy & an outcast. i'm a former drug abuser & self harmer.

i mention these things bc i think it's important that other people who struggle with this kind of stuff feel seen & not alone.

well, i see you.

and even if i don't know you, i feel love for you.

you can always reach me at j3s@c3f.net or on mastodon [@j3s@merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@j3s "jes' Mastodon account.") - i do my best to respond.

as far as tech goes, i helped found [cyberia.club](https://cyberia.club/ "A hacker collective in Minnesota.") and [layerze.ro](https://layerze.ro/ "A hacker space in Minnesota."), and i help maintain them. i write on my website at [https://j3s.sh](https://j3s.sh/ "jes' website.") and hang out in the cyberia matrix server & merveilles mastodon server.

i love software that is simple, maintainable, aesthetic, fast, and reliable. i write most of my software in [golang][go] & shell. a few of my projects i'm most proud of are:

- my rss feed reader: [https://vore.website][vore]
- my password manager: [https://github.com/biox/pa][pa]
- my website: [https://git.j3s.sh/j3s.sh](https://git.j3s.sh/j3s.sh "The source code for jes' website.")

i live in a van rn and i travel around the usa. my current location is on my mastodon profile - if you're nearby, let me know! i would so very love to meet you.

### What hardware do you use?

i'm pretty picky about my hardware.

i use a [framework laptop][framework-laptop] as my main computer! when i'm at a desk, i have a [logitech g pro mouse][g-pro-mouse] & a [keychron q2 keyboard][q2], and they're both nice!!

my headset is a razer blackshark - i like it because it fits nicely around my glasses, and pinched glasses give me a headache. i find i can wear it for a few hours!!

my chair is an old [steelcase leap][leap], i found it at an office sale - it's very comfy!

my desk is a piece of plywood suspended by a wire and a 2x4, and i use an arbitrary 27 inch 120hz monitor.

### And what software?

i'm a sucker for convenience & simplicity, and [arch][arch-linux] + [sway][] has just been a dream combo for me. i have played with [hyprland][] & use it periodically, but it's still a lot less stable than good old sway.

my editor of choice is [neovim][], and i edit most code without any modern completion features.

i like the constraint of using a bare editor. it forces me to keep parts of my project in my head, which drives me towards simpler & more intuitive designs.

here's a bunch of other random stuff that i use & love using:

== workstation ==

- browser: [firefox][]
- term: [foot][]
- shell: [dash][dash.2]
- email: [himalaya][]
- pics: [feh][]
- vids: [mpv][]
- pdfs: [zathura][]
- pass: pa
- vpn: [tailscale][] (with [headscale][])
- audio: [pipewire][]

misc: [kanshi][], [qemu][], [docker][], [keyd][], [yay][], [chruby][], [rg][ripgrep].

== server ==

- git: [legit][], [sourcehut][], [forgejo][]
- email: [opensmtpd][]
- access: [openssh][], [wireguard][]
- storage: zfs (it has warts but i do like it)
- reverse proxy: [caddy][], [nginx][]
- orchestration: my own fleshy human hands

you can check out my dotfiles if you want, there's a bunch of stuff that i use all the time in there:

[https://git.j3s.sh/dotfiles](https://git.j3s.sh/dotfiles "jes' dotfiles.")

finally: shoutout to [openbsd][], [plan 9][plan-9], [debian][], [alpine][alpine-linux], [gentoo][], and [chimera linux][chimera-linux]!

### What would be your dream setup?

a big pile of my friends in 1 place.
