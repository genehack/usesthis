### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [James Jirat Patradoon](https://www.jirat.jp/ "James' website."), an artist and illustrator specialising in animated gifs, digital illustration, ballpoint drawings, and some murals. I'm from Sydney, Australia and am currently abroad in Thailand.

### What hardware do you use?

Over the past few years of frequently travelling and moving studios I've managed to minimise my studio setup to just a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (Retina) and a Wacom [Cintiq 13HD][cintiq]. I've recently added an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] with an [Apple Pencil][apple-pencil] to my nomadic setup, which has given me a lot of freedom to draw and work on things without having to set everything up on a desk.

### And what software?

I use [Clip Studio Paint][clip-studio-paint] to draw and animate, and [Photoshop][] for finishing touches.

### What would be your dream setup?

Something that would merge the power of the MacBook, the precision of the Wacom Cintiq, and the untethered wirelessness of the iPad Pro/Pencil - basically if a Wacom Companion could run macOS, but I don't think Apple will ever let that happen since they're pushing the Pencil so hard.
