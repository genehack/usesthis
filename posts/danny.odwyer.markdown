### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hey, I'm [Danny](https://www.noclip.video/ "Danny's website.")! I'm an Irish guy who used to be a web developer but now I make documentaries about video games and the people who make them. Around 5000 people pay me every month to do this. It's nuts.

### What hardware do you use?

Oh boy, where to start. The nature of this work means you have to touch a lot of different types of hardware. In terms of cameras, I shoot on a [Sony Î±7S II][a7s-ii], though most of our stuff is filmed on my camera op's (Jeremy Jayne) [Canon C100][eos-c100] with an [Atamos Ninja][ninja] attached. For audio recording, we use RodeLink wireless lavs. We use cheap ass Fovitech lights because we throw them under planes. I could get super granular but if you want more info we made [an entire video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcH2d0GSIY "A YouTube video about Noclip's camera equipment.").

In terms of PC hardware, I use an [i9-7900X][core-i9-7900x] with 32 gigs of RAM and a [GTX 1080 graphics card][geforce-gtx-1080]. I've also produced a video about [building that machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcZUAxQqd0Q "Danny's YouTube video showing his PC build."). It turns out that when you make stuff that looks good with a really small team, people are always asking you what you use!

### And what software?

I use [Adobe Premiere][premiere] to edit our documentaries. I've worked in both Adobe CC and [Final Cut][final-cut-pro] and Premiere is simply leaps and bounds ahead of the competition at the moment. I have a subscription with RED Universe for some additional tools and affects. I use [Audition][] to edit our podcast and [Lightroom][] for any photo post-production we need. The only other software I use is all the games we play and record using [Game Capture HD][game-capture-hd].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm in the fortunate position of basically having everything I need to do our work. I think we could do with upgrading our main camera to a [C300][eos-c300] but anything larger would create more problems than it would solve. There is a universe in which I love the idea of filming on RED Digital Cinema camera but the ingestion process is so hands-on, and the cameras so unwieldy that it would negatively impact our work. I edit off of a [MacBook][macbook.2] while on the road which I think I'll probably swap for a PC when it's time for an upgrade. Apart from that, I'm always on the lookout for new lenses. A good lens can make an average camera shine. They don't have to cost the world either. My favorite lens is a [Helios 44-2 58mm][44-2-58mm-f2] which cost me under $100.
