### Who are you, and what do you do?

I’m an artist, writer, cartoonist, animation director and a teacher. As the first woman to work for DC Comics AND Marvel simultaneously, I was one of the founding mommies of _Wimmen’s Comix_. An Inkpot Award winner and an Eisner Award nominee, I'm best known for her _Pudge_, _Girl Blimp series_ (1974-1978), now out as a book (2016). Currently my adventure series, _Sondra of the Secret Service_, written by Nicky Wheeler-Nicholson, is available on Aces Weekly, a [web comics site](https://www.acesweekly.co.uk/ "David's web comics site.") of David Lloyd’s. A contributor to the Eisner Award-winning _Drawing Power_ (edited by Diane Noomin, 2019), and _Covid Chronicles: A Comics Anthology_ (edited by Kendra Boileau and Rich Johnson, 2021), my future-released work includes “Lifeblood Driving” in _World War 3 Illustrated_, and “Food for Thought” in _Let’s Bet the Planet_.

An Emmy Award winner, I ran digital design and animation company Lee Marrs Artwork for 30 years. I'm the retired Multimedia Chair of Berkeley City Colleges, Berkeley CA.

### What hardware do you use?

I use an [iMac][] (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, 2019) with a 3.6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i3, 8 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 memory, and a Radeon Pro 555X. An [Epson Expression 12000XL Graphic Arts scanner][expression-12000xl]. A 14.5“ [Intuos 4 Wacom Tablet][intuos] and an [Epson Workforce Pro WF-3720 printer/scanner][workforce-pro-wf-3720]. With my 10.5” [iPad Pro][ipad-pro], I use the [Apple Pencil][pencil].

### And what software?

For graphics, I originally used Oasis, then I participated in the Knoll brothers’ development graphics software for Barneyscan in the early ‘90s. That became [Photoshop][]. Once Adobe Photoshop became available for Apple products, I signed on and it’s been my drug of choice. I use [Keynote][] and [GarageBand][] for presentations and [Microsoft Word][word] and [Gmail][].

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be Hawaii, on a hill, on an open porch, with an endless Mai Tais... uh... I’m actually almost there, with a sunny converted garage as my studio. But I wish the outside view was an ocean with waving palms instead of my backyard
