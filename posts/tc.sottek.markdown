### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is T.C. Sottek. I'm currently executive editor at [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/ "A technlogy news website."), and founder of [The Adventure Guild](https://adventure.enterprises/ "T.C.'s game publishing company."), a small games publishing company. In both cases, I spend my days caring a lot about words: what they mean, what they do, and who they're for. I'm very privileged to get to work with so many talented people, from a newsroom with great journalists to a small team of fiction writers and artists.

I get to do a lot of rewarding things, but the most fun thing I do is definitely [writing spells](https://www.adventure.game/ "The Quest RPG.").

### What hardware do you use?

In a normal world, I split my time between my tiny gold [MacBook][macbook.2] and my custom-built Windows PC at home. But since entering quarantine I've switched full-time to my desktop. I built a new one in October, and it's definitely the most tricked-out computer I've ever made. I had high ambitions to turn an [Elgato Stream Deck][stream-deck] into a fancy control console for the [Adobe suite][creative-suite], but it's ended up just being a small screen that shows my CPU temp and the time.

It's nice to be able to turn this setup into a broadcast center when I need to host holiday trivia. Here are the full specs of this setup:

- Case: [NZXT H700i Mid Tower][h700i]
- CPU: [Intel Core i9-10900][core-i9-10900] w/ [Cooler Master ML360R RGB cooling][masterliquid-ml360r-rgb]
- GPU: An old [EVGA GeForce 980 Ti][geforce-gtx-980-ti]... while I wait for the [RTX 3090][geforce-rtx-3090]
- Motherboard: [MSI MEG Z490 ACE][meg-z490-ace]
- Keyboard/Mouse: [Keychron K2][k2.2] (Brown switches) / [Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro][deathadder-v2-pro]
- Memory: Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 64GB DDR4 3200
- Storage: [WD_BLACK 2TB M.2][wd-black-sn750]
- PSU: [EVGA SuperNOVA 850 G3][supernova-850-g3]
- Audio: [RÃ˜DE PSA1 swivel mount][psa1], [TritonAudio FetHead preamp][fethead], [Focusrite Scarlett Solo][scarlett-solo], [Shure SM7B mic][sm7b]
- Headset: [SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless][arctis-pro-wireless]
- Display: [Alienware 34 curved][aw3420dw]

Now that I think about it, there's a ton of other random stuff I use every day, including [AirPods Pro][airpods-pro] (though I try to avoid these), an [iPad Mini][ipad-mini] for watching TV in bed, a [Sonos Move][move], a Vizio 4K television, and some HyperX headphones that I swap in sometimes because they're definitely more comfortable than the SteelSeries at a fraction of the price. 

The most reliable technology I use is a [Pilot G2 retractable gel pen][g2.2] and a pocket-sized Moleskine.

### And what software?

The only thing I miss about the [macOS][] experience is specific to laptops; I really like the three-finger swipe for switching between multiple desktops / windows. That just feels _so right_.

But I love Windows. Of all the operating systems I've used -- [Commodore KERNAL][kernal], DOS, Linux, etc -- for some reason I just feel most at home in Windows. Maybe it's because my experience with operating systems was largely forged through struggle (hello, [Windows ME][windows-me]). I dunno, I just like it.

Going deeper under the hood, there's a ton of stuff I use on a daily basis. 

While I fiercely support market competition, I'm regularly annoyed that I have to have 10 different game installer platforms. Just counting what's pinned to my taskbar, I see [Steam][], [Minecraft][], [Origin][], Epic Games, Blizzard, and Ubisoft. I know there are more lurking somewhere in my system.

All of the "work" staples: [Slack][], [Chrome][], everything G Suite, [Dropbox][], [TweetDeck][], [Discord][]. Not work-related but work-adjacent: [Spotify][].

The software that really sucks me in the most is all made by Adobe. For the past three years while designing the roleplaying game Quest, I've lived in [InDesign][]. I literally have dreams about page spreads in InDesign. It feels like a second language. From there, I spend a significant amount of time in [Photoshop][], and then a lesser amount of time in [Illustrator][] and [Audition][]. I did finally crack open [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro] a couple weeks ago when I decided to re-edit _The Fellowship of The Ring_. I have a good rough cut already, but I'm sure the last 5% will take me at least a year.

### What would be your dream setup?

It feels really nice to say I'm about 95% of the way there. The only thing I could think of that would improve my setup is the stuff around it. I live in a small-ish New York City apartment, which has begun to feel a lot more cramped now that I run a small publishing company. I'd love to have (a lot) more space for storage, a drafting table for sketching things out, and probably some room for a photography studio. Basically I just want a nice office for a small business.

If I'm being frivolous, I'd love a [Maingear F131][f131] or a [Digital Storm BOLT][bolt.2] with all the bells and whistles. For some reason a gaming PC with custom hard tubing for water cooling is my version of a Lamborghini. These PCs can be configured in the tens of thousands of dollars for no reason other than to deprive rich people with poor taste of their money. (Which is a perfectly legitimate reason.)

What I really want is for PC manufacturers to stop putting RGB lights on everything. Sometimes I like to work without feeling like I'm at a rave inside of a circus tent.
