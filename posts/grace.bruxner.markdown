### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Grace Bruxner](https://gracebruxner.com/ "Grace's website."), I'm the Creative Director of Worm Club, which is a small studio with me, my partner Thomas Bowker and our wonderful composer Dan Golding. We make the Frog Detective series, which is about (you guessed it) a frog that solves mysteries. Our first game, [The Haunted Island][the-haunted-island], came out in 2018 and has done pretty well, and now we're finishing the second game which comes out this year. My role on the project is art, story/writing, design and marketing, plus more things I can't remember right now.
 
### What hardware do you use?

I use a Dell [Inspiron 15 7000][inspiron-15-7000] gaming laptop for pretty much everything. It's robust and handles a bunch of programs, and is light enough that I can take it to events. I hate using the trackpad so I have a wireless mouse with me too. 

### And what software?

I use [Photoshop][] and [Paint Tool SAI][paint-tool-sai] for concept art and marketing materials, as well as [Illustrator][] to create vectors of those materials occasionally. I use [Maya LT][maya-lt] for my 3D models, which has everything I need, I don't do anything too fancy. For the game we use [Unity][] 2018.4 (which we update often) and Tom uses some coding program which I don't understand. I also use [ScreenToGif][] for making gifs as I work.  

### What would be your dream setup?

Hmm... I'm quite happy with the setup I have, but it would be nice to have a laptop that didn't have ugly red LEDs in the keyboard. Something a bit girlier! And perhaps less heavy, too. Otherwise I like my setup a lot and don't have any additional needs.
