### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am Fabien Sanglard. Born and raised in France, I lived in Canada for 10 years and now I am based in California. I program computers and cell phones for a living. Online, I am better known for the articles I publish on [fabiensanglard.net](https://fabiensanglard.net/ "Fabien's website."), and books I authored such as the [_Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D_](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d/ "Fabien's book about Wolfenstein 3D."), the [_Game Engine Black Book: DOOM_](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/ "Fabien's book about the original DOOM game."), and [_The Book of CP-System_](https://fabiensanglard.net/cpsb/ "Fabien's book about Capcom arcade games."). Besides programming, reading a lot of code, and explaining stuff, I enjoy rock climbing and spending time with my two cats.

### What hardware do you use?

It depends on the mood of the day. I can use [The Beautiful Silent PC](https://fabiensanglard.net/the_beautiful_machine/ "Fabien's post about his quiet PC."), my wife's [Mjolnir](https://fabiensanglard.net/mjolnir/ "Fabien's post about his wife's gaming PC."), or [the Diablo 2 machine](https://fabiensanglard.net/d2r/ "Fabien's post about his Diablo 2 gaming PC.") if I need Windows, which I try to avoid as much as possible. If I am restless and need to roam, I have a [Carbon X1 Gen9][thinkpad-x1-carbon] running [Ubuntu][] and a [MacBook Pro M1][macbook-pro] which also runs Ubuntu via a [UTM][] VM. For the screen I use a huge 32" BenQ. I tried to find an excuse to buy an [Apple XDR][pro-display-xdr] but failed. I built an amazing standing desk with a countertop from Home Depot and raising legs from Amazon.

### And what software?

To write HTML for my website, I use [Sublime Text][sublime-text]. If I am on a Mac, I use [Cyberduck][] to sync (I work straight on prod, that's right). On Linux, it is a dream to keep things in sync via [sshfs][].

For the books, it is the same setup except that I need to compile my [LaTeX][] to PDF with [pdfTeX][].

For both mediums, I draw with [Inkscape][] and perform image manipulation with [Photoshop][] (sadly Mac only).

### What would be your dream setup?

This is what I described above.
